okay hey man uh so I'm gonna show you the uh planar just some of the features so you can see if you like it uh here the first thing that I have is I'm running this is the dpvco saw uh sorry Square saw triangle sign just going to these four things here right these are like the pan controls for the four corners and then this is the mix um and then the mix is just going into a VCA and then I'm just playing um like a line and it's got up here you see this is the uh um Peaks it's just you'll hear [Music] Square uh [Music] triangle [Music] [Music] then um it's just filter I have it on I was supposed to be a low pass but anyway this is just mixing between before if I take just a straight output and go here [Music] so this can be nice if you want to mix different uh waveforms together and you know make a pattern that is Shifting between them all [Music] so that is first way now pause for one second we're going to go to the other way that it I really like to use this so I'm unplugging everything here we can keep the saw I mean the sine wave which we just want one of them and instead of going through the planar here we're going to just use it so did that this brings us back [Music] so here let's turn that down for one second so this time I don't actually want a um to go through I don't want to make a sequence we just want to straight up sound [Music] and so then we're going to use two on the CV here one of them will go down to the V the voltage per octave on this one I'm just going to Route this through uh over here a spectrum analyzer scope I can't see it but it's there and then back uh not long enough back to the filter okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] like a band pass right [Music] and I'm imagine putting a delay or something and then we can mix in different things [Music] [Applause] ah [Applause] and also let's go instead of sign s [Applause] that's the filter [Applause] [Music] and you know run that through to receiver or delay or something for example [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and then if you take the other one [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but oh man I love playing like this stuff like this all the time and so you know just the two outs of the CV and you know you can really like plus an LFO or something and you can really like you know do a lot to um to control your patch in a way that you can't get really with Hands-On you know and there are other also things there's a gate here so you can press the button and there's also a cvy and X that are um uh you can like pass through uh CV signal and then have the amount of it come through as it's going in and then out which is also another way um and then you can also run out individually so it's it's really you know you can do a lot but the two ways that I end up using it the most are as I said using you also can use it as an actual pan you know I mean if you want I have an a pan device down here um and so you could use this to control the pan amount I mean left to right it's not that special or anything but anyways um you know you have that if you had a you I mean you have four directions but yeah so those are the two ways I use it four way through and then like this controlling some Pitch thing with an LFO and also a band pass filter and running it through into a delay stereo delay and Reverb on the computer and yeah awesome so anyways hope this helped you and uh I mean there's also the new version of the Plano this is planar one but when the new version came out you can pick this one up for really cheap and you know totally worth it I also have this uh joystick but the thing is is it doesn't stay in its place so it always resets to the middle and um yeah so when you want to grab it it's you're always going to be you know pushing it around it doesn't stay in its spot it has a button can be fun but it's nowhere near as good as this one which right stays into the spot that you're putting it on and has four directions so yeah although there is one the new one has a Twist as well so if you have the money for that then you get it and then you can you know go two directions and you while you're spinning uh so you have three way control imagine that instead of having this one going to the LFO from over here it was just a Twist so I can control both pitch of the oscillators separately and then another control for example anyways uh yeah peace out
