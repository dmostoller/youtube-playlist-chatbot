what I want to talk about now is uh just a quick overview a basic introduction to vcv Rack a lot of people have been doing videos on this and kind of showing this new version um but they're kind of jumping right into patches and I just wanted to for people like you guys who might not have um ever used modular before and you know you open up a synth and you look at this and you say what the heck am I looking at so I wanted to just give a quick overview and show one patch and just kind of make things make sense a little bit more for you so this is vcv rack 2 which I'm using um as a VST which you have to pay for it was free as a standalone which is very it's just great and you can play around with it but for complete integration into your Daw I would definitely recommend paying for it if once you've played with it and you and you like it um because it just makes it so much easier to use I've been waiting for them to do this for a long time so I'm super excited about it um and so basically um if you think about modular it's just the same as uh you know fixed architecture synthesizers or and and vsts and stuff except that you kind of have to build them yourself all the pieces are the same except you get to choose the pieces and you have to make the connections um so whereas in a VST you would open it up and you can just start playing and you turn something on and it works and you use the modulation matrixes to do the routing here we have to do all the routing by hand but it's not that hard um and it's not that if you just break it down it's not overwhelming I think um so the first thing to think about is when we open up a new patch here it should gives us two things one of them is this midi to CV and one is audio so basically this is the out and this is the in and so it's already hooked up to our Daw which is the awesome thing about it and you can choose the midi channel here so now if in our synth like if in Cubase if I you know um play if I hit a note here right um it will eventually play but I have to hook things up first so anyways we're going to figure out how to do this but we're just going to set up a basic basic patch and I'm going to show you the layout so the first thing what we can do is you can also download Lots they have thousands of um of of modules available my suggestion is do not download them all at once because um it's just too much to get your head around so start with maybe a couple of things I really love instru um you know the um braids I'm sorry mutable instrument stuff is good but really the basic ones that they have have enough stuff that you can you can use so I would start playing with it and then go back in and download them all so anyways let's start off and think about what is the first thing we need well we need something that makes sound right so I'm gonna show you guys we're just going to take the neoni from instra and so all we have to do here is we take the output and so like this is a Sawtooth output so if we take the Sawtooth output and put it there it's automatically blank now why is it going all the way because this is what has oscillators are con the signal is constantly playing you know when we you know when you have to hit a note to turn on the synthesizer it this is the same in your if you have a virus if you have any any and well not in a computer I mean but analog stuff they're all one the second you power it on it is spitting out that signal it's just that you're not capturing it it's not going anywhere so um you know you think about these things they're constantly running um and all we have to do is kind of build our patch to make um to be able to control these things so right now this is just playing um and what we can do to start hooking things up is if we take so voltage proactive right this is go and we put this into the voltage proactive here right so now if I play a note on my keyboard right I'm choosing the note but as you know I'm not there's no envelope it's still just triggering right so how do we make it trigger from playing the keyboard so we need an envelope right so let's just take an adsr and then this is the thing the key thing here that is a little bit difficult about um the first thing when I first got my modular I bought a bunch of oscillators some filters and stuff and then I said wait a minute how do I apply an envelope and in the norm in you know in soft synths and stuff you would just apply the amount or use the modulation Matrix but here we need what's called a VCA voltage controlled amplifier and so just to talk about these things like what voltage controlled means is that it's controlled by voltages right and CV means control voltage so if you take um so these are the things that are really important about it and this is why it's called vcv rack virtual control voltage rack okay and so you have different things and then midi remember that with the different types of things that we have from midi right are you get your voltage per octave which is different than CV just because it's one volt proactive whereas CV is not one volt per octave it's like a plus or minus 10 volts so anyways this is just makes it so that each step is you know a different note on the keyboard you have your gate which is the length of the with the keyboard press velocity uh after touch the mod wheel pitch wheel any of your clock re-trigger start stop and continue trigger so these are just the different things that I've been getting from the midi device and so one of these is going to be uh you know gate or Trigger Time right so if we put this gate into the gate of our now when you see I'm clicking my keyboard we're getting our thing to hit and so then we want to apply it so what we need is what's called a VCA voltage controlled and amplifier so um what we want to do here is just run the signal through it so if we go in and then out and then now if we take the envelope from our adsr and put it into this now if I hit this you see it is triggering oh the envelope so now we have and if I let go it's off and we have our decay here we have our sustain and our release right so we're we're getting there now what's the other thing that we you know want in Ascent in anything well a filter right so let's grab a filter and so in filters are called vcfs vs voltage controlled filters right and so there's tons of different types that we can get here um let's just pick something well you know in sticking with the um why not where I was using as if we're using well here let's just use the basic one so you can see so now before we go in I'm just going to stop through into our filter on the way so if we go here and let's take a high pass right why not and put up some resonance okay I'm going to delete this one actually um and I am gonna let's take let's stick with instrument they have a bunch of different ones um let's check this one why not okay so if we then go out the saw into the in and let's take the iPads and go out this is our cue [Music] [Applause] right and now um the other thing we could have is you know an LFO right so let's just grab uh um we'll just do this one so you can see right so we have a basic wave shape here and this is I guess the wave table out so if we put into the CV here [Applause] [Music] there we go see so I'll just put the [Music] [Applause] so this is modulating this and this is the amount right so we don't need to go through a VCA here because this one has an attenuate attenuverter on it so if you have an atteniverter you can skip so now it's just this is not applied right and then now it's modulating this right so we've already got you know a basic thing going here and as you can see that if you just think about it as individual pieces of the you know fixed architecture synth you know it'll make a lot more sense and obviously you know you can read the manuals on all of these devices that can help a lot but you know if you start small and work your way up um it'll make a lot more sense to you and so this is the key thing here is that if you're trying to apply an envelope or an LFO or something to a signal path you either need to go through a VCA or something that has an attenuator because you could just put this we could put this this output right into say the um you know voltage proactive um of the synth right let's say here so now when I'm playing I can't tune the note but this thing can see and it's going to come down here but I can't control the amount because there's no amount here you know there's no attenuator so how do I control the amount so this would be if I wanted to do if I wanted to run this LFO into the course pitch here which I might want to do this is how you make squelchy sounds you know but you don't want it necessarily full on and full off you want an amount right so you would just pass it through avca but in this time you don't have a CV signal so then you're controlling the amount here so all the way down not doing anything now I'm controlling how much of this is controlling this [Applause] right [Applause] so if you're ever thinking how do I attenuate that how do I make it say how do I do the amount of it well you're probably missing a VCA um and so yeah that is this is just the very very basic basic just kind of walk through um of thinking about it and the key thing here is right you know you need to just route the things together and if you're trying to input a modulation into a signal path and there's no way to attenuate the signal by using attenuators like in you know here 10 inverters this one has it this one you know doesn't some of them have this is the attenuator attenuator or attenuverters the difference is attenuator is from zero to full right a 10 inverters is you have their their bipolar so you can go neg I mean you know you can invert it right so this is a positive or the negative way right and to zero in the middle here so 10 inverter attenuator different but those are what you're looking for if those are in there you could you won't need to go through a VCA but otherwise you're going to want to go through a VCA just so that you can attenuate the signal all right um so that is my super basic very very basic just intro to plugging things in and um getting things going and oh one other let me just do one last thing here sorry I forgot um if I want to show you so this is a clock thing right so this is I mean this is a sample and hold and so let's say we wanted to instead of modulating this make squelchy thing we'll put this back um no well we can leave that and then I what I want to do here is use the clock out because this is a sample and hold so now we want the clock we need we need to get some signal from the synth so I mean signal from our um from the the Daw so we have the clock divider output here and this is really useful so we can put into the input here and then if we hit play are we playing um oh sorry I'm not going to clock in this clock input so now you can see it's dividing and we can choose the division of the clock here right so it's on quarter notes we could do 16th notes right now it's on 16th notes so now like we could then take the output of this and put it to say here so now [Music] la la just to give an example right so but I just wanted to show how you can clock things right so these are the clocks and you can divide this one into different notes which is nice this one is always going to be on the actual like on this the fast one so you can divide here right so that's the clock there and um that is useful okay so basically that's what I just wanted to show you the very basic setup for plugging things in using vcas modulating stuff and now I want to show you a patch that I just was working on last night which just takes in some of these some of these things so I'm going to open up this uh yep clear all right so what I've got going on here is I'm not triggering anything I'm using the clocks this thing doesn't need to be here I'm using the clock to trigger the gate so it's going 16th notes every single time then I have the clock also clocking you see there's three of them going here one to the trigger of the adsr one to this one and one to this just so that the clock that's the same rate it's just that it's random so there are two different randoms you can see they don't match up right then what I'm doing here is I have the filter and I'm modulating it with the attenuverter here and it is a high pass right then I'm modulated using the random output to clock this oh wait there we go I just had to change the key of the day and this is two neoni's right so I'm taking the saw output of one going into the FM input and then this is the amount right so nothing no then this of course kind of controls the master pitch and then this one is like the um Timbre all right foreign mode and then I'm modulating here this output is also coming to the CD input here which with this switch on up this is the destination of this CV attenuator right down to the wave folder up it modulates the split saw tooth right so it's modulating this around and then so let's just hear this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay some pretty cool um pretty cool right so this is why this this plugin I mean this thing has so much potential because you have so many cool things like these two neonis I have the real one in my uh here and you know this it sounds awesome so there's just so much you can do and you see here I'm not even triggering I'm not even I'm just using the clock to make a sequence and then mod using two randoms to modulate some of the the parameters and we're getting really cool pattern already um so yeah that is the basics of uh vcv rack that I wanted to show you and can go into more detail um later but I just wanted to give a a rundown to kind of just break it down so that it doesn't seem so um you know formidable um and it's something that you can easily get into and you can experiment around but so now I just wanted to show you how would I polish off one of these sounds right what I want to do with it how do I fit it in because that one's going all over the place right there so let's do our tricks that I showed you before so the first thing I'm going to do I'm just going to record um well actually one thing I kind of liked here is that I was getting two different notes so what I'm going to do is um I'm in um what do we mean f so I'm going to go here and I'm not sure I can't remember which ones but I just want to what I want to do is just get because uh this course knob is changing the frequency of it so let's just see here if I'm in [Music] so let's take these and go down one more [Music] [Music] [Applause] and so now what I want to do is um let's I could record it but I'm just going to show you in here in the things let's do exactly what we did before because this is kind of like all over the place so let's just try using a similar thing as before let's take infiltrator let's just do it with infiltrator so the same thing I was showing before we just want to get some modulation going on a filter and then running through some delay and on this one maybe we'll use stereo something like that let's see what happens [Applause] [Music] more like this right you can even then put some other like [Music] [Applause] okay [Music] so now let's listen with one of the other ones right [Applause] [Applause] [Music] that's maybe going down a little too far here [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so just an example here you know but again like just by putting [Music] [Music] that a little better foreign [Music] so anyways just the point to try to show you how you know afterwards you could finish that thing yeah you'd also can as I said put on other things like even if we just uh if we put on I really love going back to this I love the phasers and flanges and stuff from yuhi here now uh just to hear it for a second I'm just gonna let's go to washed or something like that all right [Music] sounds super cool [Music] foreign [Music] that is basically everything I wanted to show you guys for now
