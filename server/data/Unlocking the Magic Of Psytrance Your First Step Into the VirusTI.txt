hey everybody this is cabion and tonight we are going to be doing a video about the virus TI which is uh classic synthesizer it's one of my favorites it's really a Workhorse I think inside trans production um and it's the great thing about it is that it uh comes with it's a hardware synthesizer but the ti means total integration and so it has a VST that you can use to program it and control everything um and so this really makes it a breeze to make some complicated patches different kinds of routing um and that's why it's really a go-to synth for a lot of people uh so anyways let's jump right into it if I'm going to be going through a ton of stuff probably in this one um and so if you have any questions just note it down um put in the comments and I can uh Circle back to them in another video to answer people's questions or we can just discuss on the patreon site all right so the first thing I'm going to do here is I'm going to pull up an initial patch so I'm going to go to the just Ram a and then here at the end we have the initial patch so at the start I'm just going to be triggering it by playing notes on my keyboard um before we get into programming the MIDI so the first thing that we got here just to give a quick layout for those of you who haven't seen it for those who have just bear with me we have the oscillator section here one oscillator two oscillators this is stuff influencing how they work together which we'll go into oscillator three here you have noise Unison this is the mixer where you can go in between them we have our filters here um our envelopes this is the filter one this is the amplitude amplifier envelope and then you have other ones as well we have our lfos here The Matrix section for more complicated routing arpeggiator page here FX1 which is chorus phasor Distortion this kind of thing and then delay and Reverb and vocoder which um yeah these ones are on the last page then you have some other things here if you want to um transpose the whole thing change your outputs this is where you set whether you're going to be using the virus as a using the USB connection like I have it here or taking the actual outputs um you know like the TRS cables out also you have soft knobs and if you have a virus um TI snow then these will be really useful because you can control uh you can set any of these parameters to these knobs which is really useful all right so now that we've just gone over the quick thing we'll jump into it and you'll see how I use some of these things the first thing to just go over is so it starts out here in this classic mode in the in the oscillators we have a bunch of different ones I'm going to start out and the first sound I'm just going to go through to give a little walk through is like a uh saw a high pass saw which is a very kind of common sound for scitrans so the first thing I'm going to do here is I just want to see one oscillator and it doesn't matter which one we can go over and use this one oscillator too so by putting the balance here we're only going to be getting the second oscillator so if I play you hear it's just a straight saw now for this typical high pass saw sound um basically it's just a as I said in high pass with some nice bit good resonance on this and right here just to show it for the beginning we're going to go the filter balance so I just want the filter just one filter now what we're going to do is we're going to automate or I mean or just play do some sweeps of the filter very nice and I mean as you get already here this is like the sound now if we go and I've played different octaves you can hear if I play one octave lower you get this and if I go even lower see you're gonna get the diff the um frequency of the wave if it gets lower since it's a saw you're really going to hear those separate out and as you get higher they're going to go together so if we just do each octave [Music] so we probably want in here somewhere these octaves and then also you can do a band pass with these as well and then for this typical sound basically what we want is with some Reverb and I'm going to put some put the feedback up gonna use just even a ping pong just to see what happens and so now let's go back to the filter sweeps let's go to high pass so we can hear it and yeah let's get some sound in here [Music] put a little Reverb on here as well get a little more of the volume on the delay now you hear that we hear the low sound over here because I haven't put any uh EQ on this so if we go and then we'll want we have this I have it it's not just the basic high pass here [Music] and if we move this up a little bit more then maybe we won't get as much of the salon well let's not use this one actually we're gonna go instead I'm gonna just put on a uh Pro Q3 and just get rid of these other guys that I have and we're just gonna keep our high pass fine so now [Music] [Applause] great so uh also just so you guys know that these while we're talking about the virus TI here these techniques can work with everything so now this is the basic one um basic sound like this we just have a saw and you have um uh the high pass now other things you could do with this would be putting in lfos to the pitch um and that will kind of get you a different sound which I'm going to go into in another video so I'm not going to get into that here um but this is the very one of the you know the simplest type of patch you could have one oscillator with the uh going through one filter and not even using any modulation or anything like that and just using your hands uh to sweep this through now if you and and obviously you can use this I can I'm touching the actual um knobs on the real synthia and um just to go over the so we remember we have the uh envelopes down here so if you want to play with those on your sound as well but so that is basic high pass saw now what we're going to do is we're going to go into take the next step um with making another type of psytrance sound which is going to be instead of using one saw wave we're going to be putting these FM together so since we have um the we're taking the second one if we put the FM amount it's going to be this one going through this one and so we get we want the second because that's the multiplying so FM stands for frequency um modulation and basically uh if you take two different waves and you multiply them together then you get more complicated waves forms so basically that's what this is doing here and we'll be able to hear what happens if I start putting the FM oh so first I'm just going to take my uh filter make sure it's down here so we have our normal note I'm also going to turn off the effects so we're back to just simple sound so then we go back to oscillator so now the first thing we're going to do is just start moving this FM knob here [Music] so now if we're looking at an oscilloscope you would really be seeing how these waves are going from simple saw to overlapping multiplying and forming more complicated um uh waves waveforms now there are a couple different types here positive triangle which is going to be a triangle just up and this is all about how the way that they're going to be multiplying together and so you know just the great you can just try the different versions and see what you like sometimes triangle can be better than positive triangle waves going to be so let's do the normal triangle for now okay now one thing if you listen to it you're going to hear a little bit and maybe if we pull up our uh equalizer here just to see it's going to be moving a bit this go it's going to be um phasing in and out and you'll hear just a subtle change to it and if you watch here you can see this is phasing so the way that that's because these oscillators are not synced to each other so if we sync one to two this is going to make sure that that doesn't happen [Music] so as you can see it's still moving a little bit because that's what happens with FM but it's staying except now if we take this off again all over the place so for our type of stuff if you want it to track really well which means across different notes um and and sounding the same and not getting out of tune then you're going to want the sync on so [Music] obviously for anybody who's listening to psytrance this is getting a good sound now what you can do here is play with there's lots of different to show you the different waveforms here we can we're just in the classic mode so if you spin this dial you get different shapes from saw here to sine wave here and then when you're in a sign here you can also then choose it has lots of other different waves in this classic form um there are also wave tables and other things in different modes we'll get to later but so if we put them both to a sign you're going to get this kind of now one thing we can also do is to get a little bit more difference between them is by putting one of these octaves down and go up one octave so I can just a little more also if we go up with this one we're going to get the further apart they are the bigger uh the more the FM is going to work see now this would be about where this is if the FM is all the way up see now if we go to about halfway FM but we put this up more so um so and if you hear the difference again cyan first saw so you're going to get different effects with these and it's great to mix them in in a track um so now what we're going to do is we're going to start applying some modulation to this so first thing I'll just go back to design just to hear it for a second um no reason in particular and what we're going to do here is the first thing I want to do is I want to just kind of modulate this FM amount so if we go here to the lfos we have multiple lfos that have their built-in routings that you can take advantage of you can also route them here with this one or you can go into the Matrix select them and then route them again this way is great because it's it's not just positive direction it's also it's you can go in both so you can invert it excuse me so the net the type I'm going to make right now is I want to get some sample and hold modulation going on which obviously if anybody knows my music this is you know my favorite thing to do so the first thing we're going to do here is we're going to um we can try putting to SNH now since let's put it to say a clock of 1 8th note and let's see what happens oh sorry we have to Route it to something so I'm going to Route it to let's just say because I haven't even put a filter on done anything yet let's just go or I haven't used it I want to modulate this FM amount so we can just use this one here but actually I'm going to put it in the Matrix I prefer to use the Matrix so we're going to choose LFO want and we can choose bipolar or unipolar I'm going to choose bipolar and then we're going to do oscillator 2 FM amount put it up so to move around now if we put it to a 16th note okay great so some of you guys have seen my uh well no wait first next thing I want to show you is so let's go ahead and put that back on the eighth notes just to not be going too crazy for a minute and so we have the um oh yes we have no no before I go to that I'm going to just go into a different way so first of all we have this is putting sample in hold based onto a Time division so if I hold it down we're gonna get these movements this is great if you want that kind of motion but uh as you guys have seen in the other videos what we were talking about in the pigments and Serum is having a um a random that is for each note not for a Time division that way um for each separate note you get a different value regardless of and then it'll change on the next note rather than in the middle of the note if that note is say longer than one eighth note if like we have here so in um the virus TI this is just this one random so now if I hold it it's not going to change when I play the keyboard but every time I play a key it's going to change so this is this is just exactly what we want and so to get um you know like something moving here let's go ahead and let's add if let's put a filter let's go to a band pass actually let's just go to a low pass for a second with a little bit of higher resonance and now what I'm going to do is um also put the same one random to the filter one cut off we can inverse them so so that's pretty nice and now if we wanted to do the uh you know my median and note length trick we have this is an F sharp we have our notes throw them in then put our mini modifiers on so now we're getting a new filter cut off and FM amount for every note now we can use our density foreign so let's go ahead and also because we already have it we could just um let's just use the same one just for the purpose of this and just give a tiny bit [Music] foreign [Applause] so basically what we've done here is just the fm2 oscillator FM amount the filter cut off and the amplitude sorry the amp envelope release so this is a super simple path and you can always say it's on super psyched dog you can play with density now people often ask about how I like to do things now one thing I might do on here is when I wanted to record this I might then take the delay off and um then play around here with the density get the one I like and then I have my virus going to in Cubase you need to put it to a bus channel so I have it to a record bus and so the output of this is going to the record and then I have a recording Channel that I take the input from that bus so if I wanted to record something in here I just arm this track and just hit record foreign so I have now just put it to audio and the reason that I like to do this sometimes dry is because now like let's just see here if we wanted to just Loop this part [Music] so now I'll put a EQ here and then just what was it I had a ping pong delay something I think it was on the eighth something like that so it's a little too many of them I think at that moment so uh the reason that I like to do this by putting the delay after is because it's just easier to remove notes when you don't have delayed Tails going through everything so let's just say let's break this down and I'm gonna chop this guy up by Beats for now and let's see so we don't need [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] adjusting the SE so now I'm going to get into too much going on here just that I wanted to show you that the sometimes I'll take the things off to then do this kind of editing I mean go way more in detail in here we can fix a lot of things you just have a bit of Freedom if you bounce the somewhat clean without delay without Reverb and then you can do a lot more chopping and stuff because if you do the Reverb in the delay first sometimes it's just too wet and you really can't cut and slice in the same way and you can always add the Reverb And Delay later so all right that was the side track get back onto track with our virus so we go back in here we are at the moment using the note length and midi trick from my other videos but now I want to try something different and so we're using the random to get our SN our sample in hold rather than the timed ones because we're getting random notes coming in and so we can't predict where they're going to be and we don't know what the time divisions of them are going to be so we want to go with the note on rather than the sample and hold beat quantized so now the next thing I want to show you is how to use the arpeggiator from um the virus which also allows you to do things so I'm going to move this guy I'm going to get rid of it over here and now I'm just going to I'm going to turn off my midi modifiers and my midi inserts so that every time I hit the note we get our sound so we are still now triggering every time I hit the note we're going to get a different value here's something a little different while we do this what if we uh if you want to hear the difference let's put it to our saw [Music] also nice then also here if we want to we can choose other kinds of waves and there's tons but let's just go straight for the moment so now what we're going to do is we're going to turn on the arpeggiator so there's different modes that are going to depend on the different notes played I'm not actually going to be playing chords right now so we can just put it um we can hit random doesn't make difference if it was up or not because we're not going to be playing chords and I'm not going to be playing different notes um but these would go if you have if you're playing you know like uh C and A G then up would go up down would go down from them up and down go up down as played random you get it so first thing here is if we choose random and then there are a bunch of um uh patterns already built in so let's hear one cool now I'm just gonna I'm just modulating with my hand here the release time nice uh you also I'll a lot of times when I'm playing with um these types of patterns I like to put the note length one to this um so then I can control this on the on the actual device as well on the hardware so uh back to the arpeggiator so there's a lot of cool different patterns built in here and you have the note length you have the swing hold just play it once and it'll keep playing so I might as well turn that on different battles [Music] [Music] so cool I don't know why I'm saying cool so much but anyways uh the next thing that I want to show you is what is actually my favorite made to use this if you go to User it's going to start out and it's just going to be a very basic 16 note um pattern but what you can do here and you can you choose the resolution of this here and so I have it on 16th notes and we put the note length up a little bit now what you can do is these buttons randomize it so we can randomize the steps then we can randomize the length much better there's much more what we want and then here we can also randomize the velocity foreign type of modulation so instead of using random which will have a rant which is working with the this so each note here in the arpeggiator counts as a discrete note so we're getting a random uh value for each of these just like we did with our midi trick the only difference is is that this is going to repeat after 32 it's not going to be perpetually changing like using the midi modifiers is going to be but one thing that's cool about this is if we instead of using say random and we go to Velocity on the amount here is going to be so the velocity level is going to be the trigger so if we now play this you'll hear something quite different [Music] thank you and as you can see it's repeating and so here if we get a high value that's why we're getting now this High um envelope the release is too much so if we put this down so now low we just don't want to get so much variety there [Music] and see the thing here is now if we just hit this and we randomize it we'll get different patterns thank you so what I like to do is do a mix of some of these I would rather keep the filter on the random and also this the envelope release but maybe we can put do the velocity to make a pattern coming out that we repeat of our uh um FM amount so as you can see this is another way to and and then obviously you know I'm just hitting random here because this is what I'm trying to show you but we can you know you can do whatever you want you can get rid of these nodes and make them into ties you can make them uh you can change the length you can do everything you want in here you can make the pattern shorter if we wanted just one bar to repeat and the cool thing one thing I like about this is then you can just play a couple notes when you're and if we put a little let's get our delay going back okay so then [Music] so I'm just playing a couple different notes Here and then I'm taking my fingers off so this is nice because then you connect the clay but you have it a little bit you can choose where you want to play them but you know you're making a long note and you're getting lots of little short notes [Music] okay so let me check my notes here um okay great so basically now we've shown I've shown you the random the velocity on and then of course we have our just basic uh if we were to go um the sample and hold obviously there are tons of other kinds of um uh things here like if we wanted to just modulate instead of let's say let's try putting this triangle here and instead of having um and let's go let's put clock on say every two bars gonna go up and down and we're going to put this one onto the and so instead of velocity on let's do the oscillator amount here um going with the LFO so it's going to be lfo2 I can't really hear much difference but it's it's there um anyways so the next thing that um I want to go into is um because obviously just play around with all these different things there's a million um different shapes and everything you can use um the next thing I wanted to show is that in here if so if we have our sound we also have some very nice um Distortion and other kinds effects so let's just play this go back in thank you [Music] we have different Distortion modes [Music] some of these are going to change the sound a lot so you can play with all these lots of different variety in here we have phasers different amounts of stages we also have the EQ here this is pretty useful you can set the frequency and it's showing you down here where the frequency is oops and so there's the gain the frequency and so if we want to give ourselves a little more a lot of times you want to put the lows down a bit and then give yourselves some highs and mids we also have filter bank here which you can do valve filter comb filters so you can get really crazy effects for different types of sounds [Applause] okay so we also this this is basically a we are using an FM patch here and so now I just want to show you a couple things that we can go into here there's lots of different waveforms so here I'm going to turn the arpeggiator off we just hear our notes also going to just pull these things down to the middle so we okay so to hear the different sounds we have lots of different waveforms so there's tons of different waveforms and so you could really get a lot of variety in these sounds and again as I said if you put different amounts you can really get different types of sounds and you don't have to stay I'm going 12 semitones up and down but you can also go in between those uh and really play around with different um sounds okay so now I want to show you this also wave table here and there's lots of different wave tables and then here what happens is just to show you if I so now we're just going to hear one you can scroll through the waveforms like this so these are going to give you crazy if you're using them as fans um there are also then we have different there's wave pulse width modulation so you can modulate the pulse width here there's grain and formant so I want to try playing with this formant for a second so we've got um again there's all these different waveforms in here and then there's these things the F shift form it shift and form it spread so what we're going to do is put this spread up a bit actually here um I'm gonna put the FM amount out and let's do this one there's no just want to go over here okay so let me just here different ones foreign [Music] to this and so instead of having the uh I'm going to go back to the random here since we're not using the velocity at the moment uh the arpeggiator and um we're going to put this to that so let's go oscillator one F shift [Music] and now we're getting different [Music] so you can hear we're going to get a different F shift for each now there we go foreign doesn't do so much now we're getting nice sound also and we've got our delays here a little Reverb and so then now if we put back our other guys and let's go back to our note shift um median density modifiers bar turn these guys on too much now we tried different these ones are pretty famous these Sundial ones so [Music] so this is that kind of glassy sound right [Music] same principle [Music] we want a little more of that for sure so let's put our [Music] foreign [Music] so that is a how we make that kind of classy type sound and again this is just using these same basic three things only we're using in a different way instead of using the FM amount and having two oscillators right now we are just using one oscillator by just shifting it back over to here and then we're modulating this kind this this the F shift instead of say the FM amount or um it's one of the other ones so this is a great way um to make and and again these if you use this format there's also format simple and grain simple and complex that will do this in a different way but the one to get that this type of sound just by modulating this F shift and F spread a lot of people ask about that kind of glassy sound and as you can see it's very simple for or similar to uh the basic FM type of sound you're just modulating different parameters um and you'll find that actually a lot of the different types of sounds she makes are are very similar um concepts of of how you put the modulation together it's just using different um you know putting the modulation to a different uh place and and for that patch and um using different types of oscillators so let me just check my notes here and see because there was something else I wanted to talk about um I in the next video when I'm going to do this one I was focusing on this kind of thing using the sample and hold but mostly the random using the arpeggiator to make those notes as well and then using the velocity on instead of that and then you also have the lfos that you can use as sample and hold clock divisions so you have multiple different methods of doing this kind of sample and hold um uh modulation on your sounds and then again you can either be using the arpeggiator in here you could write your own parts or you could be doing the midi modifier and density um trick uh that is one of my favorite ways to do it if you use the arpeggiator what I would say is that after you then um uh record out some part that you then go through and as I showed you before deleting some of the sounds just finding the ones that you want and deleting the other ones um because that's a great thing about the midi modifiers is that when you put the density at 20 you only get 20 of the notes coming through so you have a lot less to delete when you're going to use the arpeggiator you might have a really full um ARP there and you have a pattern that has a lot of stuff going on so you want to delete some of those later you also can make your arpeggiator your your sequence um not an even number of bars long so that it will shift so if you make it say six instead of eight bars long and then it'll take a few bars to cycle back to the very beginning but you'll get a longer pattern that way and it'll change around um but so that these are just different ways to do sample and hold modulation for example also um using FM or say using this formant complex to do the put the modulation on the F shift as well um then you again here you know you can juice when you're done you get here go into this section and you can juice up your sound a little bit you can use the filter Banks you can use the phaser you can use the Distortion to change how you want and then you have your delay and Reverb here which again I will say that a lot of times when I end up recording this I will take these off and then do it at the end uh to my recorded audio that way I have a bit more um maneuverability when I'm uh playing with the recorded audio part um so that is basically what I wanted to go through this time next I'm going to do another video that instead of doing sample and hold does kind of longer manipulations where you get these kind of squelchy sounds you'll find that it's actually very similar to this just using different types of modulation and putting the modulation onto different things for example the pitch instead of the uh you know filter frequency or combination of both um anyway so that'll be the next one the next video focus on squelches and I'll do that in virus and I'll jump into pigments as well um but thanks for listening if you guys have any questions about anything I know it's kind of rambling all over the place but I just wanted to go through and show a couple different types of sounds that I make and I'm just going to play around for a sec while we watch and I can show you go back to it to close out so as I finish up here just want to say thank you and I look forward to hearing please put your comments and feedback and I'm happy to answer any questions thanks guys [Music] foreign so let's record this one and I'll show you something here so [Music] oh as I just said I want to take off these guys boom boom and you'll see why in a second [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we've got that first I'm just going to put it to a new channel so that's my record channel so now since I took off and that's just I've got my instrument bust just mute that now we have the tab it's great because we still have the delay here when I pull down it just makes a duplicate of that track now this is why I wonder so I put the delay here instead of on the other channel one thing that I like to do is to make yourself some of your sounds especially like kind of backgroundy sounds like this to swell in and out so I used to use this great plugin called doctor device if you guys have used that you know what I'm talking about um I'm going to do it a different way here instead of using one thing I'm going to just put on an LFO tool and show you guys that you can use this if we put it it has filter here so if we um put the routing the LFO routing up on the cutoff here put it to a band pass put the cutoff down resonance up now and we have to then slow it down so you can see some of the notes are going to come through and some are not [Music] and so this is basically just a filter moving back and forth across it [Music] all right so now let's go back to the virus and I'm just going to switch back to I'm going to put a full long note here I'm going to go back to our other sound turn these guys off so now let's do our FM [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] lead here [Music] here [Applause] [Music] all right well that was fun thanks a lot guys and it was a long video um but thanks for bearing with me I hope you guys learned something and we'll see you next time
