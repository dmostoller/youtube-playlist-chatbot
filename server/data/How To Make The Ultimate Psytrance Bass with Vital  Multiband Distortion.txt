hey everybody today we are going to be talking about vital and this is a killer synth I've been using it a lot more in the past couple in the past year or so but mostly for sounds like sound design effects leads things like that I haven't been using it in the base because I was never quite happy with the envelopes and the cut and the filter and just getting the you know kind of Snappy sound that I wanted and then I saw this video by uh Dash glitch how to make perfect side trans base with with vital and uh came out like two weeks ago I think and so I'll put a link to that down here and um there's a couple tricks in here that uh I have employed and myself and are working very well to get the sound so I wanted to show you my take on what he's done and expand on it a bit uh with some other things in the chain after vital um to make it even better so that's what we're going to do today and let's Jump On In okay so the first thing is um I've got vital here I'm working in Cubase and I've got a vital open and so let me just quickly show you uh what dashes sounds like and then what mine sounds like just and then I'll walk you right through it all right so let's check in and let's check out what the mix of these two channels sunset okay so that is um that is the base from um from from glitch from Dash glitch and here's mine and it'll be a little different because I'm a different key a little bit faster it's just for a track I was working on recently um or for superluminal track but anyways you can hear what it sounds like okay quite similar and I'll just walk you guys through what is happening and what we're doing here um Okay so the first thing to show is that we are using one oscillator we've turned it into an upward ramp by just drawing it in here and then with the phase and down these all down to zero we've got the envelope which is controlling the um you know which is a defaults to controlling the um amplitude and so we've just got the release Here set under where it will click and but but it's we're not using the Decay or anything really here just to sustain completely open so now this is the thing that um Dash's video did such a good job of explaining which is that these lfos can be used in envelope mode which you can then um you know sync to the frequency I mean the um you could go to the tempo right um and so we have these at 1 16 and so for example this is now being run to the cutoff filter here the I mean the level of the first filter not the cutoff sorry and so we can really draw in our shape um to sound exactly the way that we want and and before uh the next note will start but then the real trick thing here is using these two Envelope lfos as envelopes to both control the filter and this is the thing that I didn't really like about it was the filter just using one on using an envelope like I normally do with the Decay just didn't get it so this is a very cool trick even one didn't quite do it but you can mix two together so it's great and everybody if you want more on this please go watch Dash's video it gives a big um um I have the link below in um in the description and he does a great job of it so I'm not going to go too in depth on that I'm just going to then move on from this and so then the next thing that we want to show is is that he described how you could have um you can remove the fundamentals right and so so instead of using a side chain you have one um that is so he basically did this on one channel in uh bit wig and again Watch the video and you'll see what I'm talking about I use Cubase we have to do it a little bit differently but it's not that much different basically what I've done is just duplicated my channel and this one saying have no fundamental right and so then I have the second the third and fourth sixteenth notes of the bar of the beat um as the full one and then just the first of the three 16 note bass notes is on the one with the no fundamental so now if I open up um just these uh Pro q3s and you can see this one is the full one with the fundamental and this one doesn't have and so you can exactly see what's happening here and the rest of it all stays the same and so this allows us to um you know deal with the overlap between the kick and the bass because we hear I have a 16 I mean an eighth note kick that's sloping down a little bit but we need uh with a fade out but we still need to deal with that overlap and so by removing the First Fundamental and even a little bit of this first I mean the fundamental and a little bit of the first harmonic we're able to really deal with that and you see there's still a little bit of a spike here because um what we can also do is adjust the volume independently so now that I have its own channel we can just bring this in so if I pull it down a lot you know you get the uh Gallop feel right and now we can bring it in to where we want it to be and so this is the first step that this is basically where Dash left it at the end of his video oops that should be negative 7.5 um so this is my Dash left at the end of his video and it sounds good but most of a lot of what really um takes a baseline into that really professional quality that's going to just blast all the big dance floors is not just is is yes having a very clean simple stuff inside the synth so like our Vital again you know we're not adding up there's no effects no Distortion things like that in here you know no compression it's just saw and then in envelopes on the filter and the um and the and the volume and that that's it right and that's what we want to keep it real nice and clean and then also we don't need to a lot of times um use things like have a high pass filter which can cause some issues because you've just got a really clean starting point but still there's more that needs to be done so from here I want to build on what Dash has done in his video and show you guys what I do after this right so the first thing we're just I'm going to show you on um we'll be changing on the main um one and then I'll add into the fundamental afterwards right so I'm going to close this close these guys down so we've got our ocular scope here I've got it on the kick and based bus channel so you can see together how it's going to change and so already right we do see and you see it's very um it's it's a perfect saw right it's super clean but what we can do and what I really like to do is Okay so these there's of course many different ways to bake a cake and to make a baseline And so these are not necessarily the ways but um these are tried and two techniques that I've used and um you know other people I know do similar um variations on this right and so the first thing that's going to be very important right to really tweaking our base is going to be using some sort of multi-band distortion right so right now I have I'm using this is in um Cubase so I have quadrophones V2 I know some people love the old version but you know it's this one is great too I've also got a Fab filter Saturn here for a different kind of effect this one's on clean tube these are on tape and we'll see what's how it changes this right so the first thing let's just go ahead and play it and now I'm gonna um to make off the bypass so you see what has happened here right look at the form the waveform it goes from this very clean saw to now having some a little funkiness going on and it sounds it sounds in a way that I really like and I think really works well gonna get an extra bit of meat and a lot of grit to it a little bit more power and one of the key things that you want to do here though is if you so what's important about this is I'm not even putting the drives up here on any of them right and they're all just at zero the key thing about this is not even really adding the Distortion it's the multiband by breaking the bass into different bands like this it changes the shape of the waveform and if you if I move this bar here to change this so let's do it right now look at what's happening I'm pointing at the screen you can't see but look at what's happening in those last two notes there because these are the only ones I'm changing at the moment right so you see how it's changing a lot so we can get the cut we can really tune the type of sound that what we want so I'm gonna go back to where I had it at uh 61. where it's right in between the fundamental and the first harmonic so everything from the first harmonic up is in this middle one okay um and so you and then these higher ones you know you can put you you know I I usually will use a note frequency chart and find the um so I know which key I'm in and you know get them uh roughly between the various the different harmonics um and of course it's more important down here where there's a big there's a lot more space between um frequencies up here as everything becomes condensed then you know it and it's also this the basis most of the content is down here so it's really these two that we want this one a bit but you know you can just season these to taste right um but this is the key one here that you really want to dial in where you put in the placement of it so um now let me just show you if I do if I mute this one and I show you with a Fab filter Saturn instead let me just put this back to zero here um okay so now we're going to use Fab filter and let's see what happens here so again you see it goes from the straight ramp to squiggly guy and this sounds different here because again I have the cutoffs in different places and again let me just show you what happens if you move them you know you see how it's changing so you can really dial this in foreign and then here a lot of times I'll put a little bit of drive a little bit on this one but not on that one don't have to though and again it's not actually the drive that changes it it's the bands right so you see how this isn't really doing that much it's a little fatter right but the completely changing the whole waveform is this so um and then sometimes I'll use both so now let's try using two okay now we're getting a little bit in here because a lot of times what I like to do is have one and not have two that have four bands so maybe get rid of say this band and so we just have two I mean three sorry and can that way you know you have a little bit more variety between just and you change it and so I'd have to dial this in a bit more but you see we can get a completely different feel right and uh you know we can play with moving this around we could put it somewhere like this let me just check on the speakers real quick yeah see that sounds pretty nice right there so again um you can do a lot with to change the the character of the bass with multi-band Distortion and so this ultimately you can take a base from any synth anything any soft synth whatever it is as long as you can get nice tight envelope so you can really get that clean shape that you want and then you throw on some multi-band distortions and um you know move the cutoff points between them to dial in the character that you want so now I'm just going to keep going with just the um the quadrifuz for a minute so we'll leave that and now I want to show you um two other things that I like to do on the base because so let me open up the pro Q3 so you can see again what's happening with the waveform so if we look at the waveform of the base up here we've got this it's just kind of going straight down on a straight angle here right if I hold in here you'll see right okay so it's just cruising straight on down there and what can really help sometimes is to cut out not cut but just scoop a little bit out of some of these harmonics right and so there's two places that I find are important so one of them we can do right here on the pro queue just use a normal parametric to get rid of that second harmonic so it'll be the third bump that you see that's the fundamental first harmonic second harmonic right so we're just carving this out a little bit and now if I if we mute this off you can hear subtle but it definitely makes a difference right and now the other thing that I like to do is to scoop out a little bit more of the mid-range low mid-range up here in the 400 to 500 400 something around there and here so let's just look at it it's this area these guys right so this is what's starting to scoop out now because I turn it on this area up here right I want to dip here a little bit now I could just do it with a um parametrical Cube but the problem is is that as we get into here you know there are as the harmonics get closer together it's easier parametrics can they whatever uh frequency you're cutting you're also influencing the frequencies next to it so what I found is um something that works um a bit better for me is to use um this something like this is an analog modeling EQ from the still it's called Stillwell 1973. and so this um if we turn it on it I just have on this middle band here I put it the lowest one at 360. and now you can if we just go you'll see now if I put this up let me undo it look it's this frequencies that I'm talking about you hear that ringy like a little frog so we don't want that so I just pull it out a little bit right so you get a little dip here and then you also are getting a little bit of a dip on the second harmonic and I find that this makes a much cleaner sound all right um and so the only other thing that I sometimes like to use and also notice we don't even have a roll off here you know we don't have a high pass here um which is nice because a high pass then we would need to use zero uh um you know it we would either have a resonant Peak where we're doing it in Paramount in zero latency or we do linear phase but then there's pre-ringing issues so if we don't have to use it better and another way that you can deal with the if you have too much bass right without using a parametric is you can adjust the gain of different bands right so we can and you can see what's changing here so we can do a little bit there by doing it like that and same thing I do this sometimes a lot of times when I'm using the um Saturn I'll do that because I find that the Saturn also you can dial in the tone on each like a EQ curve on each one so a lot of times I'll put this band down a bit because it gets pretty juicy and so this is just a good way to also you see you can just bring down that bottom there so this is another thing you can do to adjust the various levels the levels of the bass um without having to use a high pass so let's go back here and then one other thing I'll show you that I sometimes use is little Labs voice of God and there's one I think called um somebody told me there's a freeware version of this that doesn't have to be uad but this is something like people use rbase or Max bass and stuff which is basically um you know this will make a resident Peak um but it just Blends it in in a way that is a lot smoother and um I just feel it doesn't muddy up the the sound unless you put it on a low frequency and smash the amplitude up then it's definitely going to be muddy but if you dial it in right you can find the frequency that you want to boost you can give it a little touch and it could just add a little bit more meat but again this is one of those things is less is more subtle you see I have the amplitude on one here right so I'm not doing that much because again you can overdo it pretty easily so now let me just turn on the um because I wanted to you also see that this spike is still happening here it's now what happens when I turn on the quads boom so when I dialed in that point let's look here again I have it 61. you see how it's changing now this first one right oops I just changed this happens it's okay so six one anyways but you see how that is also fixing our spiky guy so we don't have this summing causing a big a big spike right so that's another thing that you can use the um the multiple distortions for is to deal with some of the ways that they overlaps right so now if I just turn on the other things here and I think my Pro Q3 I also want to just put this guy back on okay so this is um yeah now let's see you've got everything on here yep so okay so now it's here this is the way this sounds with all of the with the multiband distortions on right and now if I turn them off right so still good right but super super clean and then now once we add our stuff in boom we get this just pump and feel you know and also you know something that's great about having such a clean nice starting point and doing all of this stuff after not doing it inside the synth is that then we have this nice clean thing that we can make a ton of different styles of Baseline do using um you know we could potentially change just a little bit of the um envelope in vital you know we could make it a little tighter if we want if we wanted this you know we could bring it down so we could change these things a little bit to get a little bit different characteristic and then we can use different combinations um different types I mean if I change this from tape to tube uh wait I if I change this from type to tube you get a different sound you know and um so you can really experiment and as I said here let's put it back on the second one so now we have two right I would dial in the two a little bit more um if I was gonna do it and I'm really kind of liking Justice quadrifuz right now um but right so you can really make a wide wide variety of bass lines um just by you know doing these processes afterwards and um you can turn a nice clean straight you know um tight Baseline coming straight out of your soft sand whether it's vital like in this one or serum or whatever you want to use and then apply these processes afterwards I usually just have a base a chain of these plugins that I leave here and so if I want I can just throw them all on and then just you know tune them adjust them to taste but that way I don't have to click every single time I just say this is my base chain and then I adjust each time as needed so that is basically all I wanted to show you today in props and shout out to dash for making that video and helping me to get over my uh uh get over the reasons I wasn't using vital to make base and uh you know and then um make something I think that's pretty killer definitely going to be using this and they're probably going to be making some we're making a preset pack and I'm definitely going to use this um vital now to make a bunch of Base presets so those will come out later and so I just want to say thanks everybody please like And subscribe if you like this video and um also check out a patreon that's something that helps me to be able to make these videos so thank you very much and we will see you next time
