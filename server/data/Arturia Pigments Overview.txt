hey everybody this is cabayoon and we are back with another video just want to say thank you to all my sustaining members here for your patience I know it's been a little bit uh slow getting new videos up I just want to show you that I will be getting them out uh much more regularly um in the future so thank you again for your support today's video is an overview of the arturia pigments soft synth a lot of you guys probably familiar with serum which is great um and there's tons of videos and things out there I uh got pigments earlier this year and it's become my favorite soft synth so if you've used serum this will be in a way similar but there's going to be some great features here uh that I'm going to walk you through today that really make it excel in my mind for the type of music that I make for scitrance and this kind of um you know psychedelic sounds and the main thing that I really love about it is this routing Matrix here in the middle which we'll get to but just like there's a lot of a lot of variety in different sources for modulation and um that's what we really want so the first thing here is just to give you guys a little bit of an overview uh let me just go here we make a new preset so this is going to initialize it so we just have sine wave now the first thing to show you here is that this is we see we have engine 1 and engine two there's a few different modes here you can have it analog which is just you know the real basic analog setup with three different oscillators and you can choose the different waveforms you can then choose one to be you can make them FM to each other um and then you have the mix the volumes here you also have noise and then this modulation which is adding the oscillator 3 and the amount of noise then you also have here if we go we have wave table now this is going to be the best one I think for what we're doing and if you look here so then this one has FM here we have our Unison and tune still over there we have phase modulation phase Distortion and wave folding so these are all really really cool you can just see I'm just if we just put these up you see that this is linear FM yeah so just from a plain sine wave right in uh then here if we were to go we also have exponential to get a different type of FM sound to show you what phase mod would look like let me get this right then we also have phase distortion which is going to change the shape of the waveform and then you have different targets here so different types of shaping of phase distortion so these will all give different sounds and also if you put them in con combination say with FM you're going to see with shaping the waveform a lot here so these can be put together to give you a lot of different types of sound we also then here have wave folding and then again the shape [Music] so also a really killer tone here so this is just you know basically just from a normal sine wave and then we have all of these different characteristics different types of sounds and there's three different modes of wave folding here this one's going to give us the most definition which for our purposes will sound the best so again we have the phase Distortion phase modulation frequency modulation and wave folding now again look what happens if we mix these things together Just Killer I mean we get such great tones and this is all again just from the basic waveform of a saw of a sine wave now just to show you if we were this is so wait we have a wave folder here then if we go up here it comes with lots of different waveforms built in so we have different things here if you come you'll see different waveforms there are also natural some things like a French horn or a guitar there are processed ones there are synthesizers so like Basics send things say micro boot they're going to be from other artoria things different waveforms here transform ones which are then going to have um uh wait and then also to show you in 3D here what this is a key important part is that we have the position of a wave table here that we can scroll through and if you look at in 3D you will see what's going on so this is similar to serum if you've used it before and even if we just go back to the building waves basic waveforms just to start here you see that if we in our 2D right as we scan through we're going to have square triangle sine saw and then if we go to 3D obviously we'll see that there and you can drag through by putting your cursor here as well so so let's so let's just take us just to keep going through and show you some of the features of this and this is going to be the first in a series of videos on pigments so it's going to get more advanced in future ones so the first thing here let's just so we can hear something we'll take a saw wave and let's put on our linear FM sounds pretty good so the next thing the next uh so also if you would have an engine here too we're going to keep working with just engine one but you also have this is cool in the new version of pigments they have a granular section here which we'll get back to in another video I'm really excited about this that they added this feature uh because it's just a really cool method of of sound design then also up here you have it's set on Sample but again we have our analog and wave table so uh I didn't mention before right is that we also have um samples so if you wanted to play pianos and keys strings there are samples of this so you can actually play instruments that you know are a little bit more difficult to synthesize but you would have based on samples um and so if we wanted to turn that on we would then just turn on this second one here but we're not going to use that right now we're going to stick to our single engine um and we'll be working on the first oscillator so I'm just going to put our semitones down a little bit so I can hit in the middle of the keyboard and then we go over to our filter section here so they also have great filters and so we have the multi mode we have low pass Gates different methods here format which is very cool to make some interesting sounds this will be similar to if you guys have seen as I mentioned Serum at the beginning because there is a lot of overlap it looks and functions in a way similar so it shouldn't be too unfamiliar to you guys so we have a phaser set up and then the multi-mode is where we have in here different low pass options High Pass options and band pass so just for our purposes let's set a resonant band pass so if we put the resonance up here and we have our band pass now we can also set a second filter over here and so then again maybe we could put this one on a nice resonant uh High Pass now the filter mix is going to be here so if we want both we have to go there and we can switch between them so that's the filter section works pretty simply as you guys would expect now we're going to go into the modulation section so if we go down here you can see that we have different uh we have keyboard envelopes LFO functions random combinate and macros the macros is always up over here just like serum you can route these to multiple things and um you know so you'll have your four knobs cranking everything out we'll get to that later first thing I just want to show you is the envelopes and how everything works so right now you can see that there is an envelope already done it starts out just the basic patch routed so if I hit the keyboard it's turning off instead of droning right so that's going to be um this one here and you can see that it's routed to the end n VCA this is sorry it's called they call it the envelope VCA and it's already routed to the VCA amp um so this is how you're gonna you're gonna route things in this Center area here but we just have our basic um envelope and it's an ADR you can make it in adsr I'm sorry it's an adsr but you could make it in ADR if you want dude and then just to show you here we have our LFO section we have functions random combinate so we'll go through these on this one so we just wanted to show you we have our envelope on the amplitude already routed so we can just play Keys now let's go into the lfos to just show you how this would work if we want to Route something all we have to do is if you click in this so this one is LFO one we have then here you can see we have different waveforms you can sync it um you can make it unipolar or bipolar it's going to be bipolar first and then if you click unipolar that'll make it unipolar and that's again whether it operates in both directions from whatever value it is or only positive or negative from there um so let's just leave it on a sine wave and let's see how we route it so if you go over here all you have to do is in the center section here click what you want so if we want to Route let's let's go to First we're going to do we'll just make the filter move like this right so if we click the lfa1 it just says Drag The Contours of the knob and so all you have to then do is here so I had it I want it in bipolar so now you can see it goes in both directions right from the middle value if we have it on unipolar it's only going to go in One Direction so and then but you could put it into the negative so if we wanted unipolar only down you would put it negative here so we're going to put it 100 up and unipolar well no not 100 let's put it somewhere around there if sixty percent fifty percent thirty percent so we get a little movement not going all the way up all the way down yet so then let's just change the rate here it's at a half so let's make it a little slower super easy routing and this is why this is one of my favorite things about it because now also you can just click any anything we hover over if we also wanted to do the position right now that's moving if we wanted to move this one in one direction or we could put it up and make it move it in the yeah what's going to do in both because we'd have a second one anyways just to show you it's moving around so this is just super easy and you can just add and it'll keep you can make a million of these and you know there's no limit to the route the modulation parameters some matrixes you know you'll run out of places here you can just keep going for a long time adding more and more so and then if you want to remove one of these things you just hit X and so now that's gone if we wanted it again we'd put it again so it's really really great way um to do complicated routings because it's just super easy and then when you click this it goes back away and then you see what's happening here which is really nice um because if we click away you're not going to be looking at that anymore so you can see different sections so now what we're going to do is just keep going through and show you the other types of um um functions here random and combinate so one thing I just with the function is this is something that is just gonna you can draw basically in some shapes and then you can apply this to something so this is really nice too it's kind of like envelope but you get to draw your own so again in serum you know you don't you have one or the other kind of I mean you cut everything's like a function that you draw um but this is super cool because you can draw in stuff if you want to do that kind of thing or you just have your typical traditional envelopes and lfos now there's also random and one of the things I love about this is the types of Random so if instead of um so basically we have three types we have touring sample and hold and binary the Turing what this means well first let's just sample and hold sample and hold is for whatever division you do it's on synth eighth notes and let's just go ahead and Route this so if this is two I'm gonna just all I'm gonna put it onto this guy so we're seeing it's moving let's get a little more resonance in here so it's moving so now if we go to filter two and so then you can also you can slew it by making rise and fall or you can keep them actually you know um what an actual sample and hold with no slow I'm just dividing right at the time you can set the clock here and now this is a great thing because you can actually set the clock from other things so you could have the clock being one of the functions it could be another random LFO you could do it from the keyboard or you can put it the sequencer clock which would be the sequencer or just the normal clock which is what it sets to now but that's really cool because sometimes you want to trigger the timing of a sample and hold from something else also just a great feature so we're on sync we're on eighth notes that's for our purposes that's enough now the difference between sample and hold and Turing is Turing is basically a loop of Random so right now it's nine steps long it's also on one eighth note and you can then set this um as well but it's going to be free running here and then it's this length of so if I make longer steps it's going to run longer without repeating right and then if I go shorter it's basically just going to be one step right but so the interesting thing about this is It's like a looping random right so it creates a random thing but then it runs back and you can flip it here so this is the probability for the sequence to evolve if it's at zero the sequence will always stay the same if it's 100 random then it's more it's basically just like a sample and hold so the cool thing about this is you can kind of let it go until you get a random that you like and then you just flop that down here and then it's going to repeat and repeat that random part for whatever the length is so we have 12 steps so it's going to repeat at that so this is really cool if you want to make a random part but you don't want it to uh keep going and always be random now another type we have here is binary and so you can see that this is either going to be off or on and then you have a probability so if the probability is down it's going to say don't give me any but if you put the probability up it's always going to be up so if we go somewhere in the middle then we have you know some values going up so let's show if I want to put this to something I'm going to put it to the filter um one and two amount so now what you can see is if I click off on it we are always down on filter one and now and then when these when it goes flips to the other side it's flopping over to filter two so the filters are both moving but it's choosing which one and this one we would want either you know to have it so it's either one or the other [Music] so that's pretty cool to intersperse the uh you know some different two different types of modulation on as an example here and we'll show you know when I make future patches we'll really get into using all of these in tandem with each other right now we're just walking through what the HR so that's back to our base our three different types of um random and this is again why I love this so much compared to serum because serum doesn't really have this and serum sample and hold is in the chaos section um it doesn't have a turning you can write in a like in the function mode you can and this again has three different ones here um you can draw them in but here we actually have them that are free running and we just choose a probability and we can easily manipulate this like if we want mostly uh you know staying on filter one only popping over to filter two a little bit you know we can do that if we want more mostly on filter two and staying down over there so it's you know you get a lot of variety and then remember the touring is like a looping random so now back to show you something else that is pretty cool is so you know um in a lot of times you would want an LFO running but you would want to make a more complicated LFO that's not just going up and down right and so what you could do is you could take another LFO like lfo2 and we could put it to say the timing here right so we could do that here so that it's moving at you know and this one is affecting this one so that's of course a way to do it which most most can do but the thing I wanted to show you here is this section called combinent and so this is another section of three where you can combine different um sources so let's say what if we wanted to take lfo1 which you already have and then we use the Second Source to say lfo2 we could also do random I mean you can just make really complicated things but just to show you so now look at this waveform that we've got going on here so now if we put this one to our cut off say instead and then we go back here if I want to just get rid of this one on the cut off we just delete it right super easy but now if we go back to uh oh uh combinent here so now the combinant one I put here and I doubled something up on lfo2 I want to turn this off so lfo1 is the wave table position here lfo2 is now not doing anything but instead we have this and as you can see this is moving now in a in a more interesting way let me just turn this down so now we've got a more complicated um a more complicated waveform going on and we can do and then there's different modes here you can sum or difference or you can multiply it so I'm gonna just get different mathematics right and divide lag threshold all these going to give you different results so this is a super cool way if you want to make a more complicated waveform out of the individual one so now since we're not using lfo2 if we were to go to lfo2 and where to say make it some different let's make it you know something like this now let's see what a combinant looks like so we're getting some drops and so this is just a super cool way to make more complicated things now for example just to show you one what if we put lfo1 with say random two our sampling now look at that really cool so uh this is just an amazing function of um of this synth that really makes it stand out in my mind so now that we've got a couple things moving around I'm going to just make this binary and it's pretty good actually so now I'm going to show you some of the other sections so we also have um you go to FX and we have our FX section up here and you can um there's multiple buses right now we just have the first well we have nothing in the second one there's a send bus as well so if you wanted to send your Reverb which is really useful um for example has that already and then the default patch just starts with the delay in the Reverb then you see here we can make it ping pong put our dry wet up um you can have high pass frequencies and our feedback yet so now we've got some ping pong pretty cool and then if we wanted to say Reverb also here dry wet so those are built in and then you see we can choose more so if we wanted also we can move the positions of these things um if we want so so by moving it here I can put the delay if I just move them and I put the reverb when I'll go here and so then in the first one say we wanted to put a distortion right so now we can choose different Distortion and put that so we have built um FX built in these are all great so now um what I wanted to check is um so I want to show you also is the sequencer here and so uh one of the great things about this as well is that um you know how so I'll show you really quickly if you guys see from my other videos we've watched the note length and density tutorial so I have my section here with lots of different you know just the 16th notes pattern and so let's bring this over and my grid size right so if we put this here and then we go to our midi modifiers note length there and then our density turn that on [Music] so let's go to our comment two oh because I made the LFO here [Music] comes off for a second just to show you the parts um so again we have our Rhythm coming from [Music] the fact that we're using the midi node length trick but now what I want to do is we're going to do this instead we're going to use the sequencer and we'll make everything better here as soon as I get it going so let's just see this is moving it's fine fandom II oh this is why I touched too many things got to be careful because if you're touching things then gets messed up so we have our filter to cut off is going and then lfo1 wave table position let's go ahead and make it this one slow it down a bit and now our combinant two is back looking better not going too crazy okay anyways so now we're going to use the sequencer so let's turn off this and I'm just gonna actually undo all my routing here just so that we can hear the clean um Everything clean so no routing okay [Music] good okay so now if we take away our section over there and we're just going in here turn off the midi modifiers and the midi inserts so now if I play the keyboard over here and so now let's go into the sequence so basically we have an arpeggiator or a sequencer now the difference is just going to be how they're playing the pitch the arpeggiator we could then you have a modes here so as played up down random up and down inclusive exclusive and um the sequencer is different because then you would actually put the pitch of the note here so but otherwise they're going to function the same you choose the rate here and so we have it at eighth knots if we put it to say 16th notes there we go so the thing that I love about this is if you see here we have this dice here and so we can make a random probability of our velocity trig probability gate length and slide and so if you think about our note length and density trick that's going to be the trigger probability and the gate length so let's go ahead and turn these up and you see now this higher amount here that's the amount and you can then module you can put these where you want on their own but that little lighter line that's going to be showing the value so you're going to have short notes and long notes awesome just perfect and then if we add the trig probability you can see that if we add this up it's pulling down and so some of these are going to have a lower probability playing so just a great way to make Parts come out and emerge from nowhere and then if just like with the other trick and now what we can also do is if we want we can put the sink rate here and so we could modulate that with say like one of our binary guys so we go back here I'm going to take the random three and let's put this down a little bit so that's going to give us a little bit of Randomness and now let's put the sample in hold here onto our cutoff filter foreign so we have and we remember we have our delay and stuff going but like already we have a nice lead going and let's go ahead and add in the sounds now let's put our binary again to uh the filter amount to so sometime we get this guy [Music] and our lfos here [Music] this is what I did accidentally I gotta put the clock it's a free running or on the sequencer clock sequencer clock would be good since we're using the sequence decline and then they're resetting that's that's [Music] so let's put this one on to the second filter [Music] foreign [Music] so really cool way there to build patterns out and if you see we went to arpeggiator it'd be the same because we're have to then allow it to have different amounts um make it octave here but you can put [Music] and we can change the pitch rate we can put it up random and then you can make different sounds but I don't want any different pitches so we'll just leave that you also have randomize here on the auto regen so you can apply that but I like to then do some stuff over here by modulating like the rate amount like we did with that so you get some little variety on the rate amount while the pattern's going through so this is just a super cool synthesizer with many um options to do stuff and from here I'm going to make another video where we just go straight through and make some sounds but I just wanted to give you guys first a quick overview of everything so if we just go real back real quick from the beginning remember that we have our wave table analog um and Sample Samplers here you can choose the waveforms from here you then have um other modes that you can face Distortion phase amount also wave folding so remember we can make really complicated Sounds by you know just using a simple waveform and then modulating or changing these parameters here we have our balance between the filters we have this the wave table position 2D 3D we have our filters section here and then again we have our envelopes lfos functions the random three different types and then these combinant ones and then our macros over here which I haven't touched but macros obviously we just would route to a lot of parameters and twist one knob um and then again to Route them you just click on whichever one you want to use and then you just grab some thing like if we wanted to put the position here so now we've got the component moving on the position so super easy to use um then we remember we have our um FX section and the sequencer which is just my favorite part because you have the randomness on the gate length and the trigger probability so we can just make random lines emerge and most other things we'd have to use our note length and density trick and sometimes just real nice to work within the synthesizer so that is my quick basic overview of arturia pigments and as I said this is going to be the first in a series of videos on pigments from here on I'll just jump right in and make individual patches but I just wanted to give you guys a quick overview of how the synthesizer Works before we jump in so that people wouldn't get confused so stay tuned next video coming soon on making some killer FM style lead in arturia pigments thanks guys see you soon
