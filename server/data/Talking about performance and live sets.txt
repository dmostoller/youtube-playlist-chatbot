all right all right guys we are back so the first thing I want to say about a live set is there's no right or wrong way to do it and a lot of people you'll hear some criticism from I don't know people who I think don't actually make the music or aren't DJs criticize people for say not doing enough people who like play a push play Live set well that can be a little bit boring there are reasons for it and um you know you could break down your live set and have you know a million different um you know control over everything but ultimately you know music is experiential so no matter what you put into it and you're doing in the DJ booth what ultimately matters is you know what's coming out the other side what what the people are experiencing and they actually can't see what you're doing most of the time you know so if you're sitting there fiddling with a thousand things and you've got this thing you know amazing set where you can do everything you want but it doesn't sound great then what's the point and somebody who might just be playing their finished tracks you know with uh like tractor or something like okay so they're not very doing very much it's not really a live set but you know if it sounds good that's what's important and also I think that just to say that you know producers didn't choose the term live um you know I was a lot of times say it could be called a producer set but anyways it's the organizers who decide what it's called um and there's a big range to do it and there's no right way but basically I'll show you that I have mine in two setups so I have basically tracks and all my tracks that have written color code them a little bit and I put them into two channels so it depends on how like what the setup is at the CL at the place that you're playing because one thing I always do is I put a I'll record a version of the set that's close to what I think I'm going to play um or planned out you know plan out something like this and I'll show you this side in a second um but and then I'll put that onto a onto a flash drive and I'll put that in one of the cdjs just in case you never know if your computer is going to die and it's nice that you can just put the backup on luckily I haven't had to do that but I know friends who have and it's really a disaster if in the middle of your set your computer dies and you know you don't have a backup so I always have one channel for a backup now it depends so usually you have a four channel mixer if there's two artists playing then that other artist is going to need one channel so but some places that you'll play each artist will have their own mixer you know it's some big festivals and so in that case if I have the whole mixer to myself then I'll do it the you know the way that I prefer to do it which would be that I have channel one here and I would be going to my external out and I would go out one channel and then I have my next Channel going out to another channel on the mixer and then I would have my tracks mastered and I would have the cue points I mean sorry not mastered but I would have them um warped um and I have um yeah so I would warp them and I have a free video I can show you guys how to do that it's on my Vimeo um but so I wore the tracks and then I would just cue them and then I would use the actual mixer you know to mix them in just like if you were playing them off cdjs um and ultimately that will give you the best sound and then I'll have a if I so if I have all four channels then I have two Channels with tracks and then I'll be routing um all this other stuff if you can see here whatever I have so I have if I'm using my modular I have a clock modular and has the midi then I would have my audio in which would be coming back in to and then I have now bino channel here different albino one serum and here you can see I am using some different midi modifiers like that delay EQ the xlfo which is going to the gate time and my density and I like this when I'm playing live because I can keep the density on a knob and it's all the way up so no sounds are coming through and then if I want to just let a couple Bops whatever you know some sounds from the serum um I can just do that and then I can also switch between sounds just switch the patch and the whole setup is the same so I'll do that and then all of these sounds that I'm using I route into a group Channel and then I would send that group to um the third the third output so now I have all my extra sounds being mixed through one channel and uh that way you know and so then here what you can also see is I've just set up you know if I'm using short notes like this for the midi note length trick then I just have H key and so since they're in the group I could just click the group here and everything's in key so as I'm switching keys I'll just switch the uh um which want them here and then everything is in the same key and depending if they're a long note short note whatever it is um so I can just keep them in key I have some vocal samples of random stuff here from shows and things that you would want to put in and those will go through that and then if I was using as I said any external stuff they would be over here all going through the same group and I like to do this too because that way you can have the fader if something's going wrong or something sounds too loud you just move it down on the fader okay so that would how I would do it if I have the entire um mixer available but in a lot of cases maybe one channel is broken you're on there with another person you can't use the entire mixer and so then there would be two options one you could DJ you can have the two channels out and then I would be changing this each time I switched and my main channel was going out say channel one I could switch to um sending my extra sounds to the other channel and this works but it's a little bit going back and forth also it depends on what kind of set I'm going to play if I'm playing an hour long and all the tracks are going to be kind of in the same um the same like Vibe right I'm gonna be playing more of the Twilight set or more of a darker Forest set then it's easier for me I find to just mix my tracks um you know like this playing them and using the clips to go but sometimes I like to St you know do something where I go from you know a slower let's see here I have some if we go to the master and uh show me the automation you know I have some I like to also play the tracks at their individual thing but sometimes I'll go you know I'll start out 148 sometimes if I play like two hours or something I'll start quiet I mean I'll start lower speed and then go up and so if I'm doing that attack move um if I'm doing that then a lot of times it depends you know my tracks sometimes are very different and it can be really difficult for me on the fly to mix one track with the other also sometimes I have you know two or three two tracks that I really like to play together in sequence so this allows me to do that and so if I have and also if I only had two channels available this is what I would do because I still for me I'd rather not be just DJing two tracks one to the other I get a little bored with that and I like to you know add extra sounds on top so if I'm faced with just having two channels available instead of having two channels mixing what I will do is I will arrange my set and so what I'll do is I'll put the tracks here and I'll choose where I want to play them and so what you can see if this looks a little weird why some people you see have like the latter thing where each check is on a different Channel what I've done here is I have two the two channels that I showed you before are just the tracks and they don't have any eqs or anything on them they're completely clean then I have a channel that has a high pass on to it right so what I'll do is instead of automating filters and frequencies on when I want to make the mix right so if I'm introducing the part of let's listen here ah sorry guys I can go quieter so [Applause] God damn it sorry guys get really sorry about that so I put just I just grabbed the clip where I want it at the crossover so I would like if I take this I would warp my track put it in grab this piece and shoot it up to the high pass one so then instead of having automations going back and forth and having to change things then I just put this so this is being high passed or this is being high passed and then these parts are 100 clean and I switch them on the trans silver now the reason I also like this is that I can very easily change things on the Fly say I decide that I don't want to play this track after this I can just move segments around right I could grab this if I just like grab this the top here right I could grab this whole section and no come on and I could move it and then if I want to change things right I also it's very easy because I can just add another track at the end here say I wanted to keep going you know I could just take the part that I wanted to mix in I'd be like all right I'm going to mix it here so I put that there and then I just add the next track and keep going so it allows you to rearrange things if I was using eqs and stuff on each of these tracks and I had automation I would have to change that automation every time so if I'm going to do a pre-arrange set I like to do it this way because that allows me the maximum flexibility to change things as I'm going so I still could have a pre-arranged set but I still can change things as I'm if I'm playing here I can be doing things over here changing stuff around and just letting it play through so I can still actually or you could even I could do it on the fly but I'm setting things up and the reason that I like to do it this way especially if I as I said if I only have two channels because then I'll have so these one all three of these go to the master and then the group or so the channel one on the mixer and the other group of my extra sounds goes to the second channel so then I have my mix playing out one channel and then I still have the freedom to use the faders and the eqs to add in my extra sounds because it's really nice when you're playing a sound to kind of you know put the fader up a little bit and put it down also to be able to use the effects in the uh mixer you know to you know do stuff on your sounds so this would be the way that I do it if I only have two channels available um and I want to you know I'm playing a set where I want to start somewhere and go somewhere but again it's not necessarily going to be exactly this because since I'm doing it this way like for example say I just wanted to change these two tracks right so what I would just want to do is make sure that at the beginning they're lined up where they at the break points and I'm going to easily switch these two so now which ones I was doing these two so what I can do is I have an extra channel here also this one that says tracks boost all you leave in case I'm doing my own masters or something and there's a track that needs to be volume you know controlled the volume on its own so what I can do is just switch these guys just put this one here so now put this here so you know the set could be playing while I'm doing this and then take these parts and switch them so this is going to be the intro to the next oops grab the whole thing so this one is now the intro to this and this is the intro to this so I just move that over put it in its spot you just got to zoom in to your right breaking points so put that in there um and then again go to here to where the point is this one then you just got to be curious about the fade points and then I would put this here oh and I I have to change the one other thing so I go like this and then this one is then the other thing here is now I have to change this this is the escape Velocity and and this is this one so I put that there and I put this here and now I've just flipped the order of those tracks and it took me two minutes to do less than that you know so I could be doing this on the Fly also when I'm traveling a lot and I'm playing every single night this way it allows me to quickly move things around and then again also sometimes I like to keep two or three tracks together and so then I could just grab the little chunk like that and move them around so it's almost like a modular setup where I can just move the pieces around in my set and it allows me flexibility but also the reason I like to do this too is because sometimes I really like to beat when I'm adding sounds and stuff I don't want to add extra channels and extra sounds into the you know um the uh like the peak of the track where everything's happening you know I'm gonna be adding The Sounds where there's you know in a dead part like you know where there's like a clean like I might be adding some things here [Applause] and or at the transition points and it can be really annoying when you're like jamming out playing some sweet lead and then you're like oh crap I missed the you know cue Point by you know one bar or something and you can fix it in Ableton but I do feel that sometimes when I'm doing it in this mode that I'm spending a lot more of my time counting finding the things which is essentially what a DJ is doing but I feel that um you know sometimes it can be nice instead of doing that to you if you arrange it so even though I'm still choosing the tracks but then I'm putting it where I want so I don't have to sit there and go three four five click it you know and just let it play and I can be um uh yeah uh so I can you can disable the studies bar which is a good idea uh I forget how to do that but yeah you can disable the start stop on the space bar because yeah sure it's really you got to be careful um about that especially if sometimes when I'm doing things I'm pressing the command button which is right next to the space bar and yeah so that's the worst but yeah so I I usually disable and you don't need it when you're starting you know you can just um click the top the play button and then you know if I'm using my backup what I'll be doing is I'll be I'll hit play you know touch my mouse at the same time as I hit play on this on the uh on the CD player so that they're both in tune I mean or in in time um but yeah so generally I'll be honest that I if I have the whole mixer I'll like to do it this way because then I can have two channels to mix with the um with the individual channels and you because there's nothing better than being able to pull out the bass and stuff like that on the actual mixer the one problem here is if you see in Ableton they have what looks nope not that one they have what looks to be you know a basic EQ that would work like uh on your EQ your DJ mixers but you'll hear if we if we play Anywhere hello um if we play Anywhere first of all look let's it's look what it's doing to the sound there so it's not clean it's not clear it's not transparent you would you know and I wish somebody would just like emulate the uh um Pioneer you know thing perfectly people do it there are ways that you can make there are some people who have made Max for life and and you uh or instrument racks that do it similarly using the eq8 to make your own which will sound better it's a little bit complicated to set up but don't use the eq3 even though it seems good because you could use it you know make your own knobs on your own controller but it's going to color the sound and it sounds like crap so don't use that so that's the problem with Ableton is that you know if I want to use something like this then I want to use the actual DJ mixer so if I have all four channels I'll mix on the DJ mixer if I only have two then I'll do an arrange set like this and just jam out on top and let the Transitions and stuff happen and then you know mix breaks mix things and again if I decide to make changes I still have the flexibility to move the tracks around I just don't have to actually hit you know play on the on the on the track to get it to go um so then I can be free to do other stuff but again this is just my way of doing it there's tons of other ways to do it um you know the good thing also about this though is that in if I don't make any changes from my original plan then also I have my backup recording will be exactly what I'm playing um if I'm doing it on the fly my backup is usually close to what I'm playing but not exact good enough you know I've never had to use it so it's okay um but anyways that's uh this is what I do and um yeah and it allows me the freedom to jam out on top of the set and you know I generally have more fun playing some music on top
