hey everybody uh cabion here and this video is going to be on um doing your psytrance base so let's jump right into it the first thing I've done here is I've just opened a blank project in Cubase that is my folders so I have my as you guys saw before I have nothing in these folders but I just always start up with my template it's the way I like to work so I've got my kick channel here and we have um it's just it's it's a sample of one that I've made so I'm just going to use this and we'll do kick in another tutorial um so what I've first done is I've put the kick here I've I've made a group Channel this is a folder but I also have my group track here with the kicking Bass um this will be important later but um the first thing is just also I'll route that to the kick bass bus I've created a bass Channel and I've also routed this to the kick and bass bus um and so for the kick right now I have it completely clean no eqs no um um anything no compression nothing like that and so the what I've done here is I like some people like their kicks longer some people like them shorter I like my kicks to be just about a 16th note which is right here it's going to go a little bit over into the um next uh beat but or whether so we're the first base La the first note of the bass line would be and so we're gonna have that fade out and then we're going to use either a little bit of modulation on the base to um take care of that overlap so you can hear the kick nothing special and the first thing that I do is I just set my volume to be of the kick this uh to be negative 10 decibels just good starting point um if you do put your base your kick here and I usually put my bass depending on it around negative 12 decibels so a little bit quieter than the base I mean then the kick and that just gives you a good place because if you then add all your sounds and everything like that you won't have to lower the volume when you finish um the track at the end and here let me just slow it down let's just do 148 BPM okay so the first thing I'm going to do here just to get onto our base is just make a midi um midi window and we're going to [Music] choose what note we want so let's do something I'm going to just do G all right so the first thing is I'm just going to be putting my midi notes here um and so what I want to do is I like I just make them 16th notes and then as a starting point what I do is I'll go up to the smallest division here and make them a little bit shorter so they're long um as possible but they don't go all the way to the next note that way you can use the release to have a little bit of time in between there to shape the end of the note Okay so we've got our midi pattern now the first thing I'm going to do is I I have um a base set up but I'm just going to start from scratch here so the first I'm going to do is just to show you guys how a basic the um see where is silent one okay the basic way that you make a base on any synthesizer and I'm going to use uh nope we're going to use silent because it's just super easy so if I'm here and we just need to get to first um the go to four choose an initial patch no preset [Music] okay so we just have our initial patch here and we are uh what we're gonna do is we're just going to use one oscillator so this one here we have it on saw which is all we need um now we can pitch it the octave down here maybe to get it more where we want and so then the basically we just need a filter here at a uh low pass and so a base inside trans is just applying a modulation envelope to the filter so if we put this here and so we choose filter cut off a go all the way up pull the sustain down and then we pull the cut off frequency down here we don't need any resonance so now you'll hear as we move the Decay time up you start to get the base to come through and so this is just the filter an envelope going on that cut cut off so the first thing you want to do is start here put this up and then find where you want that you can hear that and you want to get that around where you want it you can add a little bit of sustain so that the note holds after and the tiniest bit of release as well and then what you want to do is it's a combination of playing with this the Decay time and the cutoff frequency so if you want it more open higher if you want it closed lower usually you want it very near to the bottom okay so basically mod envelope affecting the cutoff of one filter that is the basic basic way that you will create a base in anything whether you're going to use silence whether you're going to use serum whether you're going to use Dune which is another one which is really great it's basically just this one thing modulating or tweaking the mod the filter envelope so that's it but now I'm gonna go to show you guys because what I really want to focus here on is not just this part because this is you know uh just the beginning step the next step is how you shape that using EQ using um uh especially the most important one for a side trans space is going to be multiband saturate or distortions um so we'll show you that so I'm going to go into I'm going to go back from Silent I'm going to open up uh trillion which uh you have to it's it's a bit of an expensive thing but it's really great um for making base because it has samples from um lots of legendary synthesizers and other sources so you really have a lot and and then you can control it the same way that I just showed you so basically here on my main one I've got the ARP 2600 Sawtooth and here is our filter envelope down here and we just turn the filter on put the cut off down see here we go I've this one it's on power filter 24 there's a bunch of different ones here in the low pass you can try all different kinds of ones so then again the it's doesn't matter what synth you're using it's this so you just gotta dial it in to where you want it okay and then just going to go over and just quickly check the level it's a little loud I know it's perfect see it's about negative 12 right there that is where we like it so to start this is okay one thing I'm gonna do is just reduce this we only need one voice we want mono and you don't ever want any resonance on this filter you just so usually you're going to want it all the way down and play with this and you see right when you get onto the line of where you want it it'll start to feel like it lags a little bit because that's it the Decay taking longer than the division of time so if you want that better listen for it somewhere around here okay so now we're gonna go and I'm gonna walk you through one by one some different um options for what we want to do which is putting on some multi-band Distortion so Cubase has this great one called quadrupuzz if anybody uh is familiar if you know about Forest music and things like this you'll know that um quadrifuz the original version which you can't use anymore on newer versions of Cubase was legendary for the bass you just basically drop it on and it sounds amazing um and especially for uh the other Steinberg uh vb1 so you put vb1 with the original quadrophos and there it is now things have come a long way and so uh we can do a lot more than just that but still this second version of quadrupuzz is very nice so basically what I'm I have it's it's a multi-band so we got four different bands here and um I have it on the tape selection here so if we just turn it on off on off on and here so this is giving us a nice line we can you can hear the Distortion the drive certain channels more but you really don't need a lot we just want real subtle again A B off on now what you can do here is you can play around with these frequencies and move these cutoffs and you hear how it's going to do a lot to change the sound what I try to do is put them in between not on top of a peak and I'll show you a little bit in the next and Saturn how to do it even more specifically so for example this is quantifas now for people who don't use Cubase we have Fab filter Saturn as you can see it's a similar similar thing we're going on here I am going to use what I like to do is actually use both of them and have a mix so I have the tape on quadrifuz and then over here I'm going to use two and so basically let's turn this on you hear what that's doing as well and so now I have the quadrupuzz muted so we're just going to do one and then this is a great way as well you can use these to adjust the levels of the Bands so that's you can hear if we have it even zero zero zero a lot of times you have a little too much bass and we'll look at a spectrum analyzer afterwards to see this but so you can use this to pull out and mix the frequencies in a way that's a little different than using a parametric EQ or a high pass filter so here I have no drive on the top one no drive on the lower just drive here on the middle and now what I like to do with Saturn is get this just look online for note frequency charts basically this is super handy thing to have which just shows the actual frequency for different notes the frequencies of every octave and so what we're going to do here is I'm going to since uh my Baseline is in G I want to put this crossover and this crossover in between the octaves so G it's going to be a 49.98 so let's see here it's going to be using the 98 so it's right around there already we can type it in if we want and then the next one this one is in the 7 800 range so we're going to uh we're going to put it onto um let's see this one 783 this is the right octave the fifth octave so let's go around 783 all right now let's try them together nice very nice and then again you can play with the relative levels here on both of them it's gonna be the mix amount here so you see we can pull out the base if we think there's too much low end we can remove it with either one of these guys and we can move these around as well if we want to try different crossovers now it's usually better if you leave the first ones and then go into the next range and then this is 1.8 so let's take a look back at our chart what's around G for 1 8 so that's 1567. so let's move this guy down a little bit there we go all right so tape and Tube only really adding any drive to the middle on this one and using the band levels to pull the bass down just a little bit so we don't have too much low end next I'm going to show you um a free plug-in called the 1973 Stillwell EQ um there are many like this this is just an example of one which basically um what I want to do here sorry I should be showing you guys this whole time let's get uh the pro Q3 open so first of all let's go ahead and that's my default as we talked about in the other videos Okay so let's look if we have off and then we turn on now you can see from the shape here that it's pretty good we've got a lot a little bit extra here that is kind of humping up that we don't need to see how we can move things here okay so now we're going to use go back to 1973. so what I was saying about this one is what we want is we want a lot of times to have a dip around here in the uh between 200 and 400 or depending on the Baseline but you really want it on the uh like third to fifth harmonics here so if we hold on top of this you can see so we're going to want to dip out these guys a little bit and that's what I have here so I have this is just set to nothing this is a high shelf which is down a little bit but the main thing I'm using here is a um EQ at 360. so if we see that's going to be right about here and see we have this little it's going to pull this range down and the difference between doing it with a parametric like I could just put it like this but this is going to impact the frequencies over here and over here some of these nice old emulations um plug-ins emulate Hardware that it's a bit more subtle and it's obviously not as clean but the way that it does it it'll pull out some of the frequencies in a way that adds character and um doesn't distort it and add artifacts so we're gonna do that and basically what I'm doing here is as you can see pulling out a little bit on the top above 12. and then here now look at that you see here and so now depending on the type of Baseline you might want a lot of this or not much but for sure you can see when it's flat and it looks like a hill here it's too much mid-range now if I just go see how we're getting this little dip here and then it goes back up this is what we're looking for and then again if you want more some like dark bass lines really take it out even more I'm gonna go about here okay um let's just move this up okay now while we're here with the looking at this what we want to do if you're going to be using any EQ parametric EQ you want to put it into natural sorry linear phase zero latency is the normal way it's gonna distort um and and and for example if you put a high pass it's going to create a big resonant Peak at the high pass frequency so if we put this to something sharper just to give it so you can tell if we were on zero you can hear that you see how it's actually boosting this right here we don't want that we want to cut but without boosting anything we don't want to create a resonant Peak so what we're going to do is we're going to put this onto linear phase and now you can hear all I'm really doing is as you can see pulling this here also I don't need I don't want to affect this too much so I'm going to move this down underneath where about somewhere between 27 to 32 Hertz is usually where I do it no resonance linear phase so you don't even hear that which is what you want we just want to get a little bit of this low stuff out of there and again remember if we want to remove the low we can pull out using our bands here um now somebody asked this in the um on the comments about from the last video you'll see some people will go into the kick and they will or end the base and they will do you know loads of little points like this to try to make you know where you're removing the overlap you look at one at the kick and you and you make these put these in the cake you put them just to fit them like puzzle pieces together personally I don't like to do this because I think that you're really adding um you're changing it too much the thing is if you look at a base and you can see it right here I'm going to just delete all these points these each the sound is very distinct each Peak is distinct from each other and so if you start messing with these things you're going to mess with harmonics you're going to change the way that it it um it sounds and so again doing it obviously with these guys is going to do it as well doing it with the um uh Distortion units but it's going to do it in a way where it's going to affect all of the frequencies rather than specific frequencies so I get a much more natural and warm sound and in general my ethos is less is more especially when dealing with the bass so um this is the basic thing that I do there I have one other little secret sauce thing that I will use which is this is the uad voice of God by little Labs which if many of people that might have used um let's say rbase Max Base these things from waves but these things will make it money and a lot of times people are trying to fatten up your base but you don't actually want to fatten up your base too much you want it to be nice and quote unquote fat but not fat in your studio fat on the PA system and your studio you're going to be using near field monitors that don't have a subtle filter even if you do have a subwoofer you know it's supposed to be a much flatter response when you're in a studio listening when you're out at in a car even or at your friend's house or out of a PA system they're going to have tons of bass so if you boosted your base too much and there's any amount of mud it's just gonna it's just gonna be the whole thing will be mud so it's better to have a nice tight clean base that maybe sounds not pumping enough on small systems because on a big system it's going to be there whereas if you have too much bass so that it sounds good out of your you know uh laptop or in your sound say perfect on your studio monitors it's going to have way too much bass um when you're actually out in a PA system so don't get caught this this whole you know I need the base to be more fat more fat yeah I don't know how we got to this place because actually you know cleaner is better than fatter what and again also depends on the type of music like Asterix is gonna get a way better base than uh me because he's working 10 15 BPM slower so there's more time for the base um to develop it has more space and so it can be louder and have more present because there will be little more cycles that of the that can complete um and so for you know faster music 150 bpm and higher we're getting into this really uh short time frame where each note doesn't have a lot of time and so there's going to be a upper limit to how much bass you can get and still have it be clean um so uh don't try to get too much too much mud so I'm going to show you this little plug-in and um this is something that basically I use it at like five percent so I'll show you do you hear anything barely right that's what we want now I'm going to turn the amplitude on this thing all the way up just so you can hear and I don't know if you can see but it's really warming it up and then we can move the frequency so you see I'm making a huge bump here and if I move it that's moving up right so I'm going to find the frequency I want to boost see now this is down here and this is up here so I want to kind of give just a little bit under you know boost this area and then I'm just going to put the amplitude down to literally one out of ten so you barely hear it just to give a little bit of a boost so for people who don't have that plug-in don't worry about it it's the least important thing that I've done so now one other thing you're gonna do when I went into my um I started it and I just made my notes Here all have the same velocity but oh so here's the key thing now we're going to test and see how this is actually looking we also can look let's get a smex this makes a scope okay oh sorry some extra soap we got to put it onto the kick base so now this is why we put the kick and base together so we have the kick base bus here so we have our kick and our base coming in very nice bigger okay so um we are watching this and that's looking pretty good our kick is still there so we've routed the kick to kick and bass bus we've routed the base to the kick and bass bus now here's the first check that we're gonna do so if we have the kick is playing if we solo it it is coming in here at 10. and if we go up to our kick and base bus we should be seeing the same number now let's unmute the base sometimes if your base is overlapping in a bad way with your kick like like let's say if we take oops this kick to all of them so if I make the kick all the way longer and now go back up to the kick and base and actually I want to just turn this up a little bit okay so yeah you're getting a little bit but we're basically we have the kick is short the point I'm not getting the overlap that I wanted to show you but basically the point is that you don't want the two things to sum to more than the individual part so if I mute the base and I mute the kick individually and then we check their volume they shouldn't up you see that's doing something so we do have a little bit of this changing here so what we're going to do is I'm going to go down to the base and I'm gonna put on a little bit of a side chain this is just going to make the first note I have a little bit less volume the other way you could do this is by also you could put the volume down I mean the velocity down on the first note but this is gonna then change the feel more and just so you guys if talk about something different for doing certain patterns and stuff you want you can play with these like for example if we want to sound the Parvati feel do it even more if we grab the first and the last but now we're getting this one let's just go back to basically normal so we could do it two ways you could do it just with the velocity or the way that I like to do it is a little bit of both so put the velocity down and then we'll also put on the other photo now I will say I'm doing this on my headphones which is not how I usually mix my kicking base um just because I'm making the video um so hopefully it also sounds super killer up there but I'm showing you guys my like tried and true technique so I'm pretty comfortable that it also sounds good um and so to go back over one last thing here so I have my fab filter here but you know to be honest actually done do you hear a big difference you're getting a little bit out here but it's total it's not completely necessary and sometimes it's nice to not have a low pass and just to use even with a linear phase but just to leave no EQ I have well I have the 1973 on here doing a little bit but it's very clean and it's mostly coming through now if I just gonna mute if I turn off the quadrupuzz and Fab filter there what what happened to the base you know what I mean this bass sounds garbage now and so for me the way that I do it is using these combinations and so if you didn't have quadrifuz you could use two Saturns have one Saturn with say three bands like this on tube and do another Saturn with uh different bands on tape and then also you can see here that you can adjust the individual frequencies for the different bands so I've put a little bit up and then coming down here you could just do play with these all different ways so you can actually EQ each different band um individually just one last thing I didn't really mention um but yeah so if you've actually seen I don't know if anybody watched uh Brainiac uh has uh some master class and when he's doing it he does this as well um he has multiple multiband distortions and so I think he uses two or three Saturns to do it so um you know it really helps to shape it so let's turn this back on and see what happens a little better way better okay so we've gotten and so then the reason I actually want to show you so I've turned off the high pass here now what I like to do is I'm going to go into the kick and bass channel here and I have a Fab filter that I've put on the kick and bass because if any of people have ever done oh God no don't quit all right guys I think I'm just gonna bail here it's uh it's gonna quit so the last thing I wanted to talk about um ah forget it just bear with me for one second guys I don't think I saved super close to that but anyways it's we'll do it again so uh this is a good moment to remind everybody uh save all the freaking time because yeah I just I didn't I don't think I saved that for a while um let's see tutorial Space tutorial newer so we have new backup let's just do that see what it's saved a little more recently okay so while waiting for this basically what I was going to say is just that I put a um a pro-q3 with the linear phase to use as my filter basically so if you want a high pass filter low pass filter and do sweeps on your kicking base so all right let's just go should have everything's set up decently [Music] close enough close enough to just keep going on and show you guys what I was the next things so if we go back up to the kicking base and we see we have a Fab filter here so this one I've set up this linear phase and so I'll use this if I want to do like if you want to do a high sweep right because if you use a filter or something like that you're gonna get the same issue you get as I showed you before you're going to get resident Peaks at that frequency so if you want to just move it out and have it clean and not stored it at all just do it like this use a high pass and a low pass linear phase and if you just leave it see if they're above and below that doesn't make a difference and you just leave that on and then I automate these with automation channels here [Music] anyways so do that now we're going to have to I'm going to show you the thing that you want to do at the very end so some people talked about multi-sampling and putting your kick you know doing every single note for example I've only been on one note here so let's go ahead and let's just say what if we do the octave thing you know do do Okay so usually what I do in this the envelopes are going to be a different size so you can um the higher frequency is going to be a different volume everything's going to be different usually if I'm doing around within a few notes it's not that big of a difference [Music] and mostly you'll find that if I personally like to work with synthesizers rather than um samples because then if you want a long if you could just you have more flexibility but I will clean them up at the end which I'll show you however it depends on what you want to use certain uh since they're not totally they make a great they have great way for them they sound good but they're not stable so in that case you might want to sample out one waveform or one one cycle one note and then or just a long note holding it like that and put that into a sampler and do it and you can multi-sample out every notes and you know this is great the thing is it's a lot of work for every single track and you know to be honest that it's not totally necessary it depends if your base is all over the place where you're gonna have to fix that but there are many ways to do it usually what I'll do is I will separate my base into two different channels so say I just have this we're going to go with the octave one right here right what I will do is duplicate [Music] and one take out the high notes and the other particular notes take out the high notes so now we have base High and we can see then we can just we have a whole other channel for this so if we want we can move these see now we're not totally in the middle of the phrase here and the main thing is we're going to see the volume is too high so you can see the high note is oh I think the base is louder also I didn't see so kick is that negative 10 let's get this guy 11.5 and so then this is negative 2.74 let's put this down like negative 3.5 and let's see how that sounds [Music] and so then the thing is we can go in and we can tweak this one different so actually the main place that it's going to matter is the uh length of the decay so we go in here to our filter envelope so now we're just affecting the middle note right [Music] so we can affect the length of this independently from the length of the other ones and so then also you know if I make my pattern I'll sometimes you know I'm just doing high notes and low notes here but basically all set at the top half of the octave can go to the high notes and the lower half of the octave can go to the low notes now one other thing I want to show you and um I'm gonna just uh let's do it on well actually we can we can put both of these together so now what we're going to do is base High both of them are going to the kick and bass so I'm going to show you one last very important thing about dealing with your base so I'm going to record the uh group of the kick and Bass with no kick just because I want to get both the high and the low and the same one together and let's go base audio I'm going to also convert this at this moment to MIDI I mean uh sorry mono and I'm going to put the bit depth make sure it's 44 1 24 bit or whatever your sample whatever you're working in let's make sure that there's not going to the desktop but it's going to the project audio folder and let's insert it to the audio in audio track all right so we bounce we have the audio down on the bottom now let's go ahead and mute the midi channels and we can see exactly what is our problem here so when you put all of these distortions onto your base you're going to first of all there's going you see how the bass sometimes when it records if we look in here there's a delay it's not actually triggering or starting on the uh first of the 16th note so what we can do we can adjust that and move it forward now I will say that I does not always need to be exactly here you'll you got to use your ear a lot of times I actually like a little bit of a delay because that's where it sounds right and you're going to have to just every every synth and uh Sound Source is different I'm going to give you a slightly different waveform but so before we play with the front there I just also want to show you that this is the other problem is that we see we have this big tail here all of this is now overlapping with the kick so now if we go and we do our kick soloed and we look at the kick bass Channel we have that and now if we put the base audio in oh I have to put it to the kicking base you can see that we're now higher because this is hitting where this is also if we go ahead and look at a smex Mexico scope gotta get the trigger to line up anyways you can see a little bit here it's a little difficult but um the point that I wanted that I'm trying to make is that it's actually better to show you just here on the waveform because you see the kick here is now going to overlap with this and so these are going to sum together and they're going to change it and you're going to get a little squeezing of the kick at the beginning and you don't want that you want the kick to hit 100 clean so we're going to do two things here the first thing is let's go ahead and just move over this um let's see I actually am not going for the well here let's let's try this we go over to this point and now if we put it oops you are all right so that is good I moved it Forward on and as I said though we can try I'm gonna just move to a little small too late I actually think it's even better here see this is where it initially was I'm Gonna Leave it where it originally was where the timing is automatically so this is what I what I really want to show you here is not about that because you can adjust that on your own the point I want to make here is if we go to 16th is specifically about this tail so in Cubase is a great thing what you can do is if you switch to the scissors and then you press on a Mac it's alt and you click in one place it's going to break it all into that many pieces so what I want to do is break the entire thing into one beat then I go back to by hitting one I move to the cursor go here select oh just need to go to the end because there is one little tiny I don't know if you can see that this stupid thing let's delete okay so then and imagine my track is you know super long here so I have a million of these but I'm doing it at the very end and so you select all events and it grabs all of your bass and then you just move the first one back so you see how it's now removed this overlap and then we can use our Fades to just fade us in here and then on the tail side it's going to be really important and if you want to zoom in it can sometimes help because we want to go and get this down to a zero Crossing so I'm going to go like that but not affect it too much that looks good so now when the kick hits it's getting clean and if we go back to our specs of scope you'll see it's hidden clear okay so this is very important at the very end remove the Tails from the base so that the bit the um the kick hits cleanly and this is this is hugely important because otherwise your kick is going to be off um so let's just quickly go over everything from the beginning so remember that no matter what synth you're using basically the key thing is a low pass filter using the Decay um to uh modulate the amount to start just using the amount of the Decay to say how much of the high frequencies come through and that's really going to give you the tone of your base and then your key players in making it sounds super killer are going to be things like quadrifies Saturn other multi-band Distortion units where you're going to put multiple points use more than one of them if you like you'll get different results with them all try all different combinations tape tube combinations of the both but these are the key things and again we can use this to add some drive and Distortion a little bit to certain frequencies and we can also use it as a way to um to do some eq'ing even though we're not using an equalizer we're going to be you know I'm pulling out a couple decibels of the of the base here and then uh something like this some sort of not parametric but some sort of shaping EQ to pull out that range around 300 Hertz so that you can um because that's that you so you don't get this little buzz ringing guy and then if you have something like it you can use uh something that you know is a base resonance tool or the max space but if you do use these things use them a very very lightly and then depending on the type of Base you can add your uh side chain and there's lots of different ways to do the side chain but a side chain or you can play with the velocity of the actual notes um and the playing of the velocity of the notes and the length of the notes is going to give you lots of different types of um uh feels you know also again if you move you know for example going back to that Brainiac video he does um he makes like uh 140 BPM daytime kind of stuff so when he does the three bass notes he puts the first one all the way down in the last two the velocity down and the next two up so you know there's going to get that really like gallopy feel um there's all different kinds of bass lines we can go over that kind of thing in another one but you can play with the velocity as well and then for my technique of doing with the high notes because I'm using trillion which is very stable is to just separate out the top half of the octave with the bottom half of the octave so that I can adjust the decay of the higher pitch notes a little bit and then also if you want to you can adjust the crossover points on the multiband Distortion and if you need to any EQ but anyways you can deal with the higher notes separately from the lower notes then finally at the end bounce it to mono and if you need to shift left or right to change the uh where the starting point is do that otherwise the main key thing is to remove this area where the tail will be overlapping with the kick so you can get a nice clean Kick Drum so that's it um please uh don't hesitate to question comment anything you guys have to go into further um I hope this was helpful and please let me know if there's anything you guys want me to revisit uh or show you in the next video on bass lines have a great day guys take care
