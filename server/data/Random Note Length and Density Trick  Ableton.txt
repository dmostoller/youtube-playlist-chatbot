hey everybody kabian here just want to start by saying thank you for joining my patreon I'm really happy to have you guys join me in this community and I'm looking forward to working together uh so yeah please don't hesitate to reach out tell me what you guys want to learn if you have any questions about these videos or future videos that you want to see just let me know so jumping in this is a continuation of the nitty midi uh length note length and density trick that I showed in Cubase before only we're going to do it in Ableton so if you haven't watched the other video I recommend jumping in there and seeing that one uh first and then this will make a little bit more sense second thing here is this is going to use some Macs for live devices so if you don't have Ableton version um that includes Max live I recommend you get it there's a ton of amazing uh plugins and and Max live devices that people have made it really expands what Ableton can do so um go ahead and get that but um for the people that don't have them I will include the midi devices that I use here so that you can just drop them into Ableton so first thing got just to match up with the other video I have a virus with uh two oscillators and going routed to the second one and we're using a little bit of FM so easy and again we're not really concerned about the sound here it just need anything to show this trick so then the first thing we're going to do is just like the other one you create your 16th note pattern I have the note lengths here at 30 second notes so we have some empty space in between but they're basically just 16th note pattern and if we listen to it here you'll just hear them evenly repeating every 16th note all right so that's how we start the next part is to use the built-in midi effect from Ableton called note length right here so go ahead and grab that you're going to switch it over to sync mode and then since we have our midi notes at 16th note divisions we will put the length to 16th note now when we play with this gate control we're going to be changing the length of the note so foreign that is the effect that we're going for we're just going to want to automate it so now um we're going to use an LFO I like to use one of the ones from Max for live there's a bunch of different good ones my personal favorite is this one xlfo um where did I put that Max for live plugs here we go sorry guys having a little there we go all right so there's this one called xlfo which I will put in which is really great I like it a lot so the first thing that we're going to do is map this to the gate and now you can see it's going all over the place the next thing we want to do is we're going to want we want to sample and hold type thing so we're going to put this to sync and then make it random now let's just start by putting the rate division at 16th notes so everything's matching up so now we're going to get a new value for each 16th note foreign that's already working pretty great um what we can do though is you know they you can set the first value here and the range here so if we don't want all the way long we can make that we could put the range a little down if we want the first one to have a little bit of length you put it here you also have the depth but that is getting the effect that we want so we'll just leave it like that the next step is also another Max for live plugin which is the density control so we're going to throw that on here as well now this one it works that when it's at zero it's letting all of the notes through when it's at 127 it's letting none of the notes through them so let's go ahead and hear that nothing's coming through all the notes coming through so if we put it somewhere in the middle we're going to get 50 approximately of the notes to be allowed to play and it'll randomly select those so it's going to create a random pattern sometimes plant and it's always going to be changing same thing our gate length is constantly changing so you're going to get a pattern here that is changing in perpetuity uh it won't loop at all um let's see what it sounds like so now let's put it in with the kicking base and we'll see well here we can start a little bit higher just here now let's put in with kicking base and that's what we're going for and then you can play around with the effects of how much you want to get longer shorter notes different density but that is it so basically just to go back from the beginning you need your you make a 16th note pattern or whatever divisions you want I'm just doing in the 16th note but you know you can that's not important you make a pattern of regular notes that are repeating you put the note length control on and match it up to the length of the notes automate the gate control with a random or sample and hold LFO then add the density control to be able to choose what percentage of the notes you want to let through so that you'll get a randomly generated part every time so that is that if you guys have any questions please don't hesitate to ask and I will get going on the next videos as well we're going to get some more um with the modular some with the virus some about mixing and things like that but if you guys have anything in particular that you're interested in learning please just um make a comment um in the patreon page and I'll get to it as soon as I can so thanks a lot guys really appreciate it have a great day stay safe
