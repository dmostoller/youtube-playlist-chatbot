hey everybody uh cabion here and I just wanted to do a quick video to uh show you guys how to warp a track in Ableton this is something that a lot of people have asked um I'm gonna go and do another set about how I set up my live set but I wanted to just first do uh this one just to show you how you take a track and how you warp it so um I will just even start from complete scratch here I'm gonna grab a track and drop it in um and so the first thing that you want to do is it helps if you know the BPM but it's not actually uh urgent so the first thing you want to do is just go and find just like if you're DJing on CD players you would find that first uh kick and you would go and you would want to set that as your cue point so I'm going to zoom in you know if you zoom in real far you get these little points um so you want to go a little bit just below that you can see here probably right around where it crosses the one point you want to get a zero Crossing if you can so something like this would be good you can always adjust this later so anyways the first thing to do is to set a yellow point at your first kick then what you're going to do is right click or control click if you're using a laptop and you set 1.1 here so that will set the one there and so if we just play from there [Music] we'll start the track right at the beginning now you'll see here that I still have this yellow point back here that came when it first set in so you want to get rid of that and also if there were any there might have been a lot of yellow points that come out that were already set up in here but you'll get rid of these by when you first set your point if you just set one by one here and then the next thing to do is you say wipe from here straight so this will warp the track based on what uh if it's BPM not the BPM of the track you could also do work from here at 150 which will set it at the track BPM or you could do BPM from here but basically the one you want for your live sets is to warp from here straight so let's do that now you see that it's gotten rid of these other um points so we don't have them anymore and uh that's what we want you don't want to go through and make lots of yellow points because basically if I put a yellow Point here and I move this it's only moving what's in between so it's not going to change this point it's only going to change the part in between if I put another one here you see that it's stretching this part and stretching this part out so every time that you move something with the yellow dot you're going to be distorting the rest of it so again we don't want any yellow dots except for our first one here so go back and let's work from straight again so that's going to set the whole track straight now what we want to do is we want to go somewhere near the end of the track I have a little bit of a fade out here so let's find a nice kick this one looks pretty good so we can see here that it's not exactly on this is our kick here so what we want to do is you see that there's a little Point here that you could turn into a yellow Point by double clicking it don't double click it just use that point without double clicking it to drag your place over and you can zoom in to get uh you know the different to get it so right here now we see we've got a zero point right there zero Crossing so that's what we're going to want and so you see I did not create a new yellow point so basically all we have is at the beginning of a track we have one yellow and at the end we have gone in and found um one point and fixed it now if we go everywhere in between we'll be on so if we go to 148 we're right there very good so now [Music] that is warp track so I'm going to start I'm going to grab one more for you guys so let's say um uh uh what other track did I just get here all right whatever it doesn't make a difference really which track it is I'm just gonna show you a new one but so it really doesn't make a difference just pick one here subtract loads it has we oh and again the one thing too here is we want our things on repitch this is important part repitch so let's follow the process again I'm going to go and find my first place that looks pretty good so I set one from here warp from here straight zoom out delete that first point go towards the end find a clear kick this looks good enough yes there we go and without making a point drag it over if you need to zoom in to get it right and there you go one point and that's all now if we were to put just to show you that they are working if we were to put don't I don't like this eq3 but just to show you um I don't use this really but just to give you the idea of it so for uh so here we can turn off the mids and highs and leave the lows of this vertical track or if this is me in vertical [Music] thank you [Music] so as you can see those two tracks are lined up and it's pretty simple process so thanks a lot thanks for watching I'll be doing more soon take care
