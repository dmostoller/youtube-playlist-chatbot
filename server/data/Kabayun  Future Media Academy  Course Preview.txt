cancel close all right so we're back to the beginning here and we can see our sound over there so what we're going to do is we're going to turn on b and we're going to do fm and we're going to want to [Music] put this down and let's go we're going to do basic shapes so we're going to choose just a sign or saw here and then over here we're going to choose one of these spectral ones [Music] kind of like where that's going so anyways the point here is not as much specific sound but how we're gonna use it so okay we've got our basic little fm sound let's go ahead and we can see what happened to the waveform as i showed you before now let's go ahead and add a little so and we have to apply this to b and we can get rid of level because we just want one okay and probably we can put this to a band pass and you see the octave that we play has a big effect over what the sound sounds like so now we're going to i'm going to show you the trick in cubase so that we can generate a pattern with this so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to create a blank midi part i'm just going to make it shorter one bar just for ease of drawing everything let's go ahead and zoom in here so we're over here find our octave probably this one and i'm going to make 16th notes and then i'm going to make them a little bit shorter so that they don't overlap so let's go make them just about that long so we're getting them the part just going around and there's a little bit there because these ones aren't synced so you can see that the sound is changing a little bit between them um which is fine and so now what we're going to do is to get set up our the the rest of the note midi trick so if we go in here we have basically what i've done is just make these 16th notes and if we go here in um the midi modifiers section over on the inspector what we can do is we have a bunch of controls here um to control the mini so the first is obviously transpose which can be useful if you put your notes in the wrong place or just trying different octaves so we can change it there you can also shift the velocity if you want it to be louder or i mean higher velocity lower um these ones don't really need to use these are going to set the divisions um what we want is these guys these little random ones so you can randomize the position the pitch the length and the velocity if we were to randomize the pitch this is what we did in the percussion one because we were using different samples so this will randomly select different notes so if we do this it's going to pick different notes and if we go so that's going to get lots of different random values it's not going to be in a key though so if you wanted to do this kind you can go into the midi inserts and there is midi modifiers here as well and if you do it in this place you can then choose a scale so i think we're in f sharp we could choose something arabian and then now if you do the pitch and randomize it it will only play notes that are in the arabian f-sharp still not exactly what we're looking for but this can be you know if you want some bleepy kind of sounds and you want random notes but you want them to be in a key you can use this what we really want here is the length control so what we're going to do is by putting if we put this down and the maximum up this is basically saying that for every note that it's going to play here pick the the length so it's going to modulate it by to make it smaller or longer now these numbers don't correspond to actual times um let's see sorry uh tillin says yes so the mini modifiers in ableton um i can show like we can open up ableton in um in this lesson and i will show you how to do that uh it's a little bit you kind of have to use a little bit of a trick there's a max for live um density plug-in it doesn't come in normally so that's the next thing i'll show you but you can do this in ableton by creating this same pattern and then you put on the note length midi device which is built into ableton and then if you modulate the note the gate time on that then you will and if you were to use a stepped random lfo to choose the different note lengths that would be essentially doing the same thing and so if we hear it now so this is what we want some shorter notes some long notes now you'll notice if it plays a longer one and it goes into the next it will skip the next um but what we can do here to make a little bit more space is by going into into the midi modifiers and we choose density and this is what you'll need to get uh there's a couple macs for live ones i think it's called density i can give them to you i have it it's just a little tiny file so if we put down this to 50 right it's going to say for each note there will be a 50 chance that it will play and so we'll get approximately half of the notes coming through if we put it even lower we'll have less coming through so when we use this in the the other day in the percussion we were using the density to just pick a few random ones and then we were using the pitch because it was a sampler to choose different notes which would be a different sample here we're going to modulate the note length and then put the density down so that we have a bit of empty space so nice already we get a little pattern to them and now if we just unmute this and make our loop bigger so then i'm going to hit four which is glue in cubase and i'm going to glue those four so that they're bigger and we'll go this long and loop it oh another thing i want to do is since i'm done with these parts for now i'm going to this way i can keep everything organized i'm just going to drop these into my leads in fx folder so i drop those in leads and fx is muted so we don't hear them now and we're back to nice clean look also can pull that down so so we're getting a pattern all ready to emerge um yeah no chance from max for live yeah that can be uh cool i haven't played with that one but the cool one thing that's great about ableton compared to cubase is that there's this you know unbelievable resource of of of max for live devices so basically anything you think you can imagine um it can do um so yeah ableton's very cool for that but you kind of have to sometimes search a bit and try there's also another um there's aja's funk arp which is cool and that has it's a little max for live device that will play um different note lengths and different patterns there's also um mono sequencer now this one's really has a lot of complexity to it and is very very good but it can do exactly the same thing too so yeah there's a bunch of great um plugins for max for live that will do the same thing but this is something that's built into cubase which is just you know one of super useful and so one of the reasons i'll do this is imagine we wanted to write this part here we'd have to you know all the time you're thinking about writing midi parts you know short short short long short short long long short these kind of things and you know it can be difficult to you know you know make hundreds of them per track and hundreds of tracks and everything and you're always trying to think of new midi parts sometimes you know exactly what you want you just want to dot dot you know some stab thing or something little boop boop or you know exactly what you want but a lot of times when you're writing a track you kind of i personally like to you know as i said let let it kind of emerge um and so one of the ways i'll do this is by making a few different parts with this random setup you can get different notes in different places let the pattern kind of emerge and then you go in there and fix it a bit before you know and and and remove some overlaps so um we've got our basic pattern here and so now what i want to do is i want to modulate some different things and so let's just say if we were to put something to the cutoff frequency so now in there's a couple ways to do random stuff here you could use the chaos which would be on a sample and hold so on a time division but that will only do it on the time divisions the thing here is since some notes are going to be longer and some are going to be shorter we would want i kind of want each let's well let's hear what it sounds like so if we do if we go to the matrix and we put the source as chaos one and go to our filter cut off and put it up now when we go here so it's moving around but it's always going to do it on whatever division we choose so we've chosen it was oh i have to do bpm sync so if we do it at eighth notes so every 16th note is going to be a different one and sometimes the notes are longer so you're hearing it's changing in the middle of the note in the middle whereas we would rather have each note be its own thing so instead of that we can choose um note on rand and so this will give us a random note each time the note is played so that's doing a lot better job because we're not getting it moving in the um so if each when each node plays it's going to have a random value and then the next note is going to have a different value so what if we also apply that to something else say we could do the wave table position on this or we could put this one here slow down so i've just put a slow one here moving the wave table position around so not only are we going to be getting a different note on each different band pass a different cutoff frequency value but this is going to be spanning around as well you also could put say we could try putting so the um note on random so some other things as well what if we put it to the um oscillator a um amount of the oops it's going to be oscillator so now this is going to be moving as well and if we do it more or say if we want to go negative direction so now we can see different fm values as well do do so i want to do one more i'm going to also make i want to have a note on random um we have a second one so it's going to be slightly different random not the same one i'm gonna put this one just to the oscillator i mean so the um envelope um release so that sometimes we get a little longer notes here uh now we have i have put a delay on here but i'm actually going to turn these effects off because what we want here is so this is randomly this this part is is i didn't write it it's randomly um playing different notes so what i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna duplicate a larger area and then i'm going to record this so i'm just going to export this out as serum fm1 still on sierra make sure everything's set and export so because we did it using this little midi modifier note length and density trick we're basically saying okay within this time play how many did i have uh play one third of the notes randomly select them approximately one third and then each time choose a different note length now i just want to show you here if we choose a much higher note length and then i record this again we will see a different you'll see some longer notes come through and also let's do i like sometimes to have a higher density and then even a really low density so that you can kind of tease in the part you also can delete them but let's see what happens when we do it like this so now we're gonna have a couple longer notes and it's gonna be a different um you'll see so that's just an example of how when we set the different parameters you'll get different things coming out so this is less notes than this one and obviously they've come up in different places because it's random so i'm just going to mute i'm going to actually put that onto the same channel so we have it here so now i'm going to put on the effects to this channel so that we that way when we want to delete some of these parts we can delete them so let's go we just have a little ping pong i have it set up to 1 8 dotted now it's also first step is put on our eq okay decent and adjust the volume and usually just with the basic volume things at the beginning i will just make sure that it's not louder than anything that's there so usually like if the i don't want it to be louder than the kick or the bass um and somewhere in there you'll see especially at the end when we go through and clean up things we'll really dial it all in but for now i just want to make sure that you know it's not louder than any of the other parts so i've got this lines at negative 12 as long as it's around there it's good so we're getting some louder notes and some smaller notes we could compress this we could do some other stuff but for now we're just going to let it go and so now i just want to show you why i did two so if i wanted this sound and i was kind of trying to lead it in i might not start out with the one that has all of the different notes i might do the one that had less notes first if this will not lag okay so in the first section and then already so we can hear in this one i'm gonna go through and clean everything up and just choose which ones you like move the ones you don't so those first ones are good i don't think we need those that one's good but maybe we put it over here a little bit earlier so that they're coming in at the right you know at a different place in the in the phrase so don't need that one those are good and let's see what it sounds like with these other guys that we had and we can also maybe put this one for the second area so they're not overlapping if this would let me do it there we go so so already that's sounding decent um and just an example of how so also for this second part here i would probably you know listen through here and there's not all these we're not going to want necessarily all of these but i might leave them now and then add some more parts and then once i have some other part you know a counter point to it because a lot of times what we want is we want you know call-in response and so in the first section you obviously see i've left lots of room for other parts to kind of call in response and for sure at the beginning of a track you'll hear that you want to leave you know as you t as you introduce sounds and we'll get more towards composition ideas later but as you introduce ideas that you don't want them to be too thick at the beginning so you want to leave some more space and then as it fills in and you get going throughout the track that you're going to leave less and less space but still you might want instead of you know these guys going the entire time to have some other sound counterpointing but since i don't have that yet i don't have um i would just leave this one write the other ones and then when i make another part and then i say oh okay this one should happen when this one's not and this one should happen when the other one's not and so i'll go in and delete it but so what we can do now is just go and leave this here we'll drop it up into our folder and so that then we can move on
