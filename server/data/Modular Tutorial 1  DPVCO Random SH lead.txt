welcome everybody today I'm going to be showing you uh how to make a simple patch an FM patch on a modular and um here it's going to sound like this when we're finished [Music] okay so now I'm going to turn off the bass and the kick and come over here and we're gonna work on it together so the first thing that I want to show you is so basically what we're using is we are using the um dual Precision vco from radical frequencies which is a great dual oscillator could use any anything that's a dual oscillator but this is just a real simple one straightforward that sounds great so I'm going to show you that so first thing I'm going to do just I'm going to break the patch out just so you can we can just hear what's happening directly um from this end so basically what we have yep so this is our output from the saw here and it's just going into this oscilloscope here and then I'm going right into the output down here okay so this it's got X exponential and linear FM and I'm running them both so we can just try to see what it sounds like that's with no FM that's linear and exponential right so the first thing that we want to do is we want to tune the oscillator so what I have here is I have I'm just running the other the first so basically what this is the one oscillator then gets goes to through the other and so this is the carrier and this is the modulator the second one and we're running out the modulator so the carrier one is is going to set the um the tune of it so I'm just running this this orange one you'll see here is going into the second channel so if we now go to this and we'll just put it on to tuner and if we go over to the 2 so here now if we play with this you'll see we can tune it so I'm going to tune it to an a because that's what the bass is in so I'm just playing with the fine tune here all right so now we've got our first oscillator tuned so now the second oscillator what happens here is this changes basically it's like the ratio essentially of the exponential FM this is actually it but it's just the further apart the more ripping it'll get right so now what I'm doing is in order to get a gated sound right instead of going directly into the output here I'm going to wire it back in I'm going through this really cool little low pass gate so instead of using an awesome I mean an envelope um like an adsr basically if you feed this different a CV I'm taking the gate from my micro midi umidy um here sorry this humidity this takes signal from the DAW and I'm running that into the CV so basically different note length right will trigger the low pass gate then I'm running it into a high pass filter just to add a little bit more um modulation there we can play with it but you could just run it straight out but so um now I'm so if we take this instead of going out there we go take the output of our oscilloscope of our you know tuner oscilloscope so we just want to watch what's going on so now if we go back to the oscilloscope seen the first one and now if I take we've got the output going into the filter and so if I take the high pass filter here and then now I just need to hit play on the Daw to make it uh run so let me do that and turn it up okay so now we're getting our pattern here and I'm using a note length and gate note length modified here let me just show you this for a sec so if we go over to the computer if we come over here I'm using the density control so just 16th notes and I'm using the midi modifiers see here to change the value of the note length okay so now back over here now so what I showed you is that if we move this we get different cool sounds so now what I'm doing is I'm taking the um using this it's a sample and hold random by intro and I'm going to run that into the um voltage volts proactive of this so now if we find a thing and then I'm using it in unipolar here can switch it to bipolar so you can see up and down [Music] so this is the amount so every time we get uh um a gate a note it's going to trigger a different value here quite simple and then I'm running another one which is doing the same thing over here to the frequency of our high pass just to give another little modulation there and this is the ssf Randstad so also taking just split out the clock from the trigger here okay so triggering it and then so now what we can do is find our little sweet spot here so I'm going to put it back to unipolar so it's only going to go higher than that let's add a little bit of linear too [Music] [Music] okay now I'm going to make the density a little bit less here I mean more so you hear more notes coming through so I'm putting the density at like 77 80 now see that's gonna be too high if we put the mount down a little bit and switch [Music] I kind of just like it going higher gives that nice [Applause] feel so very cool huh and this pitch doesn't matter because it's just a tone Timbre kind of you can play with different this is like the range we kind of get down here [Music] [Applause] if we put this a little bit lower then we're gonna get a little bit more range and then put the sample and hold them out higher okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to record a sample of this um so then we can put it into the track and and see what it looks like so I'm just going to hit record on Cubase over here and here let me show you so back over in Cubase now I'm going to record one take [Applause] foreign enough this is just to take here that I did before so now the one thing I want to show you is um so I'm going to just move this down to another channel so we're not messing with our input there our input Channel turn that off and mute this for a second so now if I come in here the one thing I want to show you is I you know there's sometimes a little bit of record latency I have that it's very small but when I hit record it just you know delays the recording a little bit I have my settings in but I just go in and I just do it afterwards it's really not that big of a deal it's a little Annoying if you're trying to track multiple Parts at once but you know it's not the end of the world so now if I move that actually that one might not be the bet well yeah see now you see here we're we're right on right on the grid there so um now let me just move this out of the way here because I had put um a delay here so now if we go into this Channel and um play that I just put a dubstation ping pong delay okay I can mute everything first and also I put a send so I'll just mute that for a second so now if we hear it and we can add in the kick in the base so you can hear [Music] a little louder okay pretty cool and now if we add in the dub station [Music] [Applause] now so I'm gonna put this one back here I'm going to put on the layers Lanes I mean show you so I had this one or this one and then a little bit of uh Reverb [Applause] [Music] now let's hear it with some percussion [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you all right so that is how you do it a pretty simple patch [Music] but um very cool I like it and I'm gonna just come back in here to show you one more time in the synth so just to recap remember it's basically just tuning the first sauce sorry tuning the first oscillator to the key then setting using an FM to then modulate the uh voltage per octave volts per Octave of the um channel that is the the carrier for I mean the modulator and using a sample and hold for that that is then going each time there's Gates and then I'm running into a low pass gate here now what we could do another way is you could keep it inside the Box by you know instead of um look here I'll just show you that right now let me mute everything and come back in here and um just go like this so one thing we could do is If instead of going through the low pass gate we're going to go here we're going to send the signal through a VCA instead right and then we can use this very cool thing native mutable instruments Peaks the first one with the Dead Man's catch firmware so this is a random ad so now if we take instead of taking the gates and um actually we'll just keep everything the same so we're going to keep the gates and stuff but instead of doing a random gate length I'm just gonna have to make this a little bit longer need a longer cable so we take the gate and we come over it doesn't matter if it's a getter trig but we come over to this this Peaks and put the trigger in there and then we will send the output of this to our CV in here so now if we run this and oh I have to [Music] okay now I'm just going to put turn off the density and the midi modifier so they're just straight notes and then what we can do [Applause] so this is the length here right longer right and this is the attack here and this is the Decay this is the random Decay and this is a random velocity [Music] [Applause] so by putting a bit of delay right and then we can play with different things here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] okay I like that so I'm gonna take a recording of this now and let's see what we've got over here so let's just record do one loop on it in over in Ableton I mean in Cubase [Applause] okay so now here if I come back and show you Ableton again oops to show you Amino Cubase I want to keep saying Ableton so now again um here I'll just put it next to it here so the same thing we just want to go in oops and we just want to make sure that the first little point we're starting where we want and you can see again my record latency it's there just slightly so we'll just take that there and then put it and I'm just gonna just so we have the different sections I'm going to put it down here actually we can do the lanes again ah no let's just set it up keep going make a longer Loop all right so now let's hear what happened there cool and now let's hear [Applause] okay [Music] cool [Music] see another cool way also [Music] [Applause] and then we've got oh yeah let me just put them all next to each other so we see them all thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] cool so that's the faster with less density there I mean foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right well I hope you all enjoyed this video and um we'll come back for more all right
