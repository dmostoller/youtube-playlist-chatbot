hey everybody Kaba Yoon here and I am going to show you in this lesson how to use uh some of the cubase's midi modifiers and midi inserts to help craft the midi note base midi note lines um without writing them out by hand so uh the first thing I'm going to show you here is just I've got a basic track open in Cubase I've got a kick and a bass and I'm going to be using the virus TI for the sound but this this doesn't really matter you could use anything here so the first thing it's just going to set up quick sound so that we have something to trigger so I've got the initial patch here and um if we play a note it sounds like sorry about that if we play note it sounds like this all right so that's good and but when I'm just going to make it a little bit more crunchy by just putting the sync on here going FM so now this one's running through this one and we put the semitone down a little bit uh so the this octave is down we've got a pretty nice little sound right there uh nothing else to do for now um just to set that up so here's comes to the meat of this lesson what we're going to do is we're going to create a small mini clip here and we are going to put midi notes at every 16th note so my Baseline in this was an F so we're just going to choose the pencil tool and we want 16th notes sorry about that so 16th notes on f one two three four all the way through so now if I play this it's going to be pretty boring but you'll hear what so I think that's probably maybe one octave too low there so let's go ahead and shift this up there we go so basically we just have 16th notes playing every single 16th note and they are all the same length so uh here is where the magic happens if we go over here in Cubase we have this thing called midi modifiers so uh this can be very useful uh first of all if you have an um a line here we can use the transpose to shift it up or down so that can be useful without having to move all your midi notes around if you just want to change the octave but what we're really going to use here is this little random Matrix here so you have two Targets and you can choose position pitch velocity and length and this is the one that's really going to help us make our midi lines so if we choose length now we have a max length and a Min length and these can roughly correspond to uh you know like a the 16th note or a half a sixteenth note at certain tempos but basically what I found is you can just kind of play it by ear I tend to around 30 seems to be about making it one time longer so if you want it or half as long so 60 would be about twice as long 90 would be one and a half or two and a half times long and so on and so forth but it depends on your Tempo so uh really you can just play around with it so what we're going to do here is we're going to make the max value let's make it say 60 for now and we'll have some shorter Notes too so basically this is saying that some of the notes can be shorter than the 16th note and some can be longer and we're allowing a little bit more length to be bigger than smaller so now if I hit play on this you'll hear what happened all right so we get some longer notes there and if I just make it even longer you'll hear some extra long notes so already we're getting a midi line to come out of this but the next step is really what's going to make this uh sound very fantastic and be something that you can use over and over again there's a lot of great things here in this midi insert section but the one that we're going to focus on right now is called density so basically the density is at a hundred percent so what that means is that it will play 100 of these notes if we then go back to density and we pull it down to say 50 percent now it's going to only play 50 percent of these half of the notes and it'll randomly select which ones to do and then our midi modifier is going to for each node triggered randomly select its length so somewhere from negative 30 to 120. so a few times larger to about half the size so now what you'll hear is uh only half of the notes and a lot nice midi line starts to emerge and even if we put it down even lower say to 20 now you really hear a lot of negative space coming out thank you so that is the gist of it and remember in our thing here we have really nothing going on it's just you know these two oscillators a little FM just to give us a little grit but what you could do then is you know to get a little movement on it just for example here let's say we put uh we've got our high low pass filter here and we just put this triangle LFO it's already there let's just put some to filter one so now we're going to get a little movement if we put a density back up you'll hear them and then we play around with these numbers all right cool right anyway this is just the beginning you can have any number of patches and this is a cool thing too because say here you know I've got my um you know I've got some presets in here for my stuff so if I were to just pick one uh and play it foreign so that is again all the notes are being selected with this random thing and you can choose any sound and it will make a meeting line for you and every single time it will be different because it's always randomly selecting now this is just the beginning of what you can do with these midi modifiers you don't have to do it as 16th notes you could do them as eighth notes and the same thing would happen it would randomly select some of them to play and the note lengths would be randomly selected as well if we go back in here there's you also have some other choices you can do velocity which will you know so now some of these would be a little bit quieter and some will be randomly selected to be a little bit louder they also have a pitch control however this one um is if you do it here and choose notes these are going to be semitones so this would be 12 semitones up and 12 semitones down if you do it like this uh let me go back to our initial patch so then what did I do I had a little bit of FM here and back down with the LFO going uh to the filter one okay so now if you hear we're gonna have random pitch [Music] which you know it's not bad the only thing here is that it's not in a key it's going to be playing any semitone so this is where the midi inserts can be really useful there is an option for a midi modifier in the midi inserts which you'll see is basically the same the only difference is this one if you were to choose the pitch you can choose a scale so we could choose Arabian Dorian major minor whole ton of scales so let's just pick Arabian and we're in F so let's choose F now so now if I put 12 12 semitones or let's just pick down six and let's go up for C get a little more here so now [Music] so it's randomly selecting pitches but it's only choosing notes in the Arabian scale of f so this can be really useful if you want to do some random pitch modulation but could keep it within a scale but the main thing I wanted to show you and the focus of this is how to create random note lengths and using the density control to randomly select a percentage of the notes to play through and if I just put in the kicking bass here now too let's see what we got [Music] [Music] all right so you can see that a little uh I didn't write any note any anything myself but we've got a nice little midi line there and as I said this can be reproduced with any synth anything and it's just a way to have the computer program help you to make the lines so you get a little bit of control Randomness in there so that is the end of this lesson and uh check back for another one I'm going to show you the same technique using Ableton Live with Max for live plugins and then also check back we've got a whole bunch of videos I'm going to go big dig a little deeper into the virus as well as other stuff so stay tuned and thanks for watching thanks everyone
