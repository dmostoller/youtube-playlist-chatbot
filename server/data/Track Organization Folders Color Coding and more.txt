hey everybody Kaba Yoon here and this video is going to be about uh project organization and color coding and some things like that um so this is something that is really important to me um I find that it's a lot easier to work when you're organized um and whether it's a solo track a collaboration uh whether you're just starting or you have a project you already have made that's becoming a little bit hard to you know see what's going on see where you're at and you can apply these techniques um to to organize things a bit so let me just go ahead and jump in here and show you the way that I organize my tracks and I'll even I even have a Cubase template project with these folders already set up so that as I start I can just um you know I already have the folders made but you can also do it each time differently if there's no set of rules so the first thing that I do is in Cubase you can create here folder tracks now this folder track then you can name here so if I wanted to make a new one let's just say I said uh you know fills or something it would make a new folder here and then I can put the tracks into that so if I make an audio track inside it now and then oops you drop that let's get out of that cancel you drop this into the fills folder and so now it's underneath it so you just basically can Nest them now in Cubase these folders are not actually um they don't have any routing so you can't do any automation on it if you want to create a like a bus track you have to do that separately so let me show you how I do that then with my kick base for example so I create a folder track for my kick and my bass and here I have uh the kick which is an audio I have my base which I've now at because it's the end of the I finished this track is uh rendered out to audio here I have the midi which is now soloed um so these are in a folder here which I can solo and unsolo but they're not actually routed together so I also have a group track here that is the kick and bass and so for an individual uh track here in Cubase it would be routed to the kick bass bus now in something like Ableton Live uh the when you group a track it'll put it into the folder as well as uh making it on a group channel so you have kind of both of them in one in Cubase it's kind of a separate thing and so here I'm just using the folders for organization so you can see I have my kick base here I also this is my percussion folder so if I just pop that out you'll see that we have our percussion here and then see this is the great thing you can really collapse like I have my whole project and we can see the whole thing here and then if I pop out my leads now you know we have leads and FX channels are all here and then what I do is I also uh have another folder where I put well I just call it instruments and this is where I have all of the things that I'm actually working on that are that are um you know for recording in and I'll show you um I have one which is set up with my virus TI I have a record uh one for recording live takes from the virus for example here I have serum and this um you know just render in place into the audio and then I have my midi which I'm sending out to my modular and to my other external synths and then I have my audio in which is taking from um the I have a Mackie multi multi-channel mixer and so I run that into my um my audio card um which is the Apollo twin um so that I just have two so I have two inputs there so I route everything into the mixer and then into here so yeah basically I have my this is what I use to create all the sounds and so for example you'll see here uh this is the sound I ended up not going with but you know I had recorded here something from um the Novation Peak so say I was going to use this sound here um I'll just remember which one it is but if it was unmuted here so what I would do is after I I put this here I put whatever things on to it I was going to I have a Fab filter and a ping pong delay and then I was ready for it and I said all right I'm finished with this I'm going to go on to making the next sound and then I would just drag it up here and so if I pop it I would just drag it into the leads in FX and so that now this channel became right here it goes down to the bottom and so now this is part of the folder so I would close my instruments and keep going now this is another thing that I find really important you'll see here that my track is laid out like a staircase walking down from left to right and this so the way that I find this is also very important because at the end of the project when I'm going to be mixing things together say I wanted to mix this part right here where this um sound I just put is so say I'm listening to the track and I have I'm I'm you know watching over um on the mixer and I'm looking at things you know there's a few parts all playing together at the same time here now if these part these tracks if like this track 10 here was up here and this sound was down here and also we're looking at things kind of bigger right I might be working in this area on these sounds and I would just be seeing what's going on here so I have some other things that are happening that are out of the screen so what I would do here to just make this problem go or not to have this problem is I would just move all of these things next to each other like this so I would move all the channels where all the sounds are into the same area to kind to create uh which which then when you zoom out is what gives you this kind of staircase feel and then you know that all of the parts that you're dealing with are right there on top of each other so for example if you're trying to do something like let's see where this uh here we go these sounds you can see that this sound and then this one is here this one you can see them in relation to each other and I ended up not putting this sound because it actually ends up overlapping with a lot of the sounds that are already there so I got rid of this one and then again because I don't want to be confused by things I pulled it out I left it down here to see maybe I'll use that later maybe it would be somewhere else but I just threw it back into the instruments folder so that it's in there with things that I haven't decided on yet and I might pull in so by organizing it like this it's going to really allows so right now if I was listening through to this track I could just be soloing I could solo only these channels that are playing right here very easily and I would be able to then using an equalizer looking at all of the channels on the stereo or just individual ones with fabfilter Pro Q anything like that you can sometimes see the other channels but you just have it this makes the end a lot easier because all of the sounds that you have are they're happening sonically in the same place and you want to put them visually in the same place so that you're able to easily find everything and you're not searching through oh where's that sound where's I can't figure out where that little bleep sound is you know because you put them visually all together so we've talked about oh the next thing is color coding now the colors that you do don't matter at all um you can make your own custom color sets I personally like them to just be as different as possible so I can really see it quickly but uh you know I usually do my percussion as yellow my atmospheres is one of these green things my leads and effects I like blue because it's a neutral kind of looking color to me so it has uh with the contrast on my screen it's easy on the eyes and I'll keep everything color coded I have one thing here that you'll see is yellow this is I just wanted a different color because this is the vocal sample and I want to be able to just locate that very quickly um and the kick and bass I have red and green again the actual colors don't matter the point is is that it's color coded so that you can just easily see things uh where they are you'll see here also I have a couple pounds that are red this is another thing I like to do is if you use everything in a single color then I'm going through and I hear you know what this sounds something's not quite right about it so what I'll do then is change the color of that one to just be red so if I thought that this part here was needed a little work but you know I'm on something else I'm working on something else just make it red which means you know what come back to that and fix it do something later and then as I go through I'll you know when I fix that I would just then turn it back to the neutral color and I would know that I had taken care of whatever issue I had heard before you can also write yourself notes but sometimes you don't have a piece of paper around or you don't want to switch over and write it down you just give that visual trigger to remember to yourself you've got to do something to that part before you come back to it then another thing about organization that I suggest is um to use for some of the preset the plugins that you use all the time like if you look here you'll see that I have Fab filter on the fabfilter pro Q3 on nearly every channel some of these have already been rendered out and they probably had it already but so what I I don't want to have to put a high pass and a low pass on every single time that I open it up so for example just if I I'm gonna get rid of this one here and so say I was working on this sound that I just looked at before now I want to put the pro Q on it I just type my guy in here and it's already got settings on this and I've already just set you know uh high pass and a shelf and another shelf and then the low pass because this is a good starting point because very easily I can just be like if I only want high pass and low pass I've just got that here if I want to have a little bit of shells which sometimes can be not very useful I've got that and then the first click I have is going to be a bell you know there are Bells here so this way I don't have to kind of dig through and it can be already and it just saves a ton of time because you're always going to be adding the high pass you're always going to be adding the low pass you might as well set that up I also have a few others like my ping pong delay here just a built-in one I set it up a little bit with the high and the low filters on it and a little bit change just because that way I don't have to dial in some of these things every single time I do them and every program is different the way that you do that but it's pretty simple like for example in Cubase you just set uh the default preset here and so in Ableton and other things they have that as well but default presets is a great way to save yourself some time while working so that's basically everything I know is a little bit rambling but I'll just go back through at the beginning uh or from the from the top so organize make folders uh for your tracks and then color code those so that you can easily see different sounds that are in different things and you can make your own different ones if you want this will also help later if you were to you know do stems because then I have my four stems here atmospheres leads and effects perk and kick and bass and you could just also mimic those with a group Channel or an actual bus if you need to but organizationally organize them like that make the staircase so that you can see all of the parts you are and that's just by moving the you know when moving the parts around vertically to line up where they would be so that you can see all the things at the same time uh and then set um use default presets and that's basically it so thank you guys very much um this is something again there are no rules on this this is just the kind of the way that I do it I just wanted to give you a little example but organizing well if you have a track already written out go ahead do this first right go right into it now the next time you open up some project that's all over the place put your things into uh groups color code them make the staircase and you will see how much easier it is to do the final mixing steps especially if you have over 100 channels I mean it can be really complicated if you have things all over the place so go ahead and do that then also you know the next time you start a new track a new channel uh yeah a new project um set it up right from the beginning just make the basic groups add the color codes and then save that as a d as a default project also in Cubase you can do the same thing save as template so I could save just these groups without actually any channels filling them um and so then right when I start out I've got my color codes and I'm ready to go and I think you'll find that this helps you to work bit faster especially and at the end when you're doing the mixing stages but basically all the way through so thanks guys I'm gonna jump in with another video in a few minutes on virus TI but I just wanted to do this subject which is near and dear to my heart color coding and organization so thanks make some comments if you guys have any questions and we'll talk again soon
