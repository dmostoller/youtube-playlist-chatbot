hey everyone cabayoon here and we are going to do a quick video on a percussion trick that I like to use um this trick what I like to do is you know you have here I'll play you a little sample of the track that I've got going here so we've got our basic percussion rhythms going on and here's the loop so just basic basic percussion Loop but now what we want to do is I want to I want to kind of tease um the percussion at the beginning of the track for our intro and then to have some nice little accents and random kind of hits with a little bit of delay that move around and give a little bit of a you know a moving feel to it and let us introduce the percussion before we come in with our full loop here so if I go back to the beginning we'll hear that I've just put a couple little um I've taken the uh rolling hi-hats and I've muted most of them and just left a few so you can hear that oops ignore that Groove agent for a second [Music] okay so we're starting here with little accents on the percussion on the close hi-hat but now what I want to do is I want to get some snares some Toms some other stuff and just have a little you know stuff like this you know um excuse my vocal terribleness but uh so anyways what we're going to do here is we're going to use a sampler so I'm in Cubase and I'm going to be using the groove agent which is the built-in sampler that comes with it if you guys are using Ableton or anything else there you know you could use battery you could use the sampler drum kits in Ableton you know they have the drum racks so basically anything that has that that's a sampler and so I've just you know I pulled up here um you know for the purposes of this of this video it really doesn't make a difference so I've just pulled up one called vintage kit 3. and if you're here I'll click all these things we have a crash another crash ride two rides Tom another hi-hat Tom crash Tam snare an open snare so that's not with the um and then a close snare here and a cross snake so although that's pretty good um the one thing is is that I am not going to want this kick we don't really want to kick going on even though it's high passed so I'm just going to mute that here and so what we can do is once we get our rhythm going we can just mute any of the ones that we don't like so I'm going to start by muting the kick and then I'm going to show you guys um how we're going to do this so the first thing is if you guys have not already watched my note length and density uh trick please watch that because this is going to be using the same technique um only this time instead of using the midi modifiers to control the um length right we're going to do the random pitch so basically let's open this up I have just created um a one bar Loop where it's just 16th notes all on the same note so if we just go ahead and if I'm going to mute I mean solo this channel so we can just hear it and I'm just going to duplicate this out a few times so that we have uh you know a longer section here so right there it's just playing 16th notes on the same note and what you want to do here is you want to kind of find the range where the notes are so up here there's no hits because we only have one octave down here there's nothing [Music] are our hit so it's about one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten semitones up and one two three four five four down so we could put this anywhere if I wanted I can move it up uh you know a couple so we have like you know eight up and eight down something like that anyways the point is if we go here to our midi modifiers and we activate it then we're going to go to random and in the other ones we wanted length because we wanted to make different note lengths when we were doing a midi line on a synthesizer but here because it's a sampler what I want is I want it to randomly choose to hit some of those different notes um so instead of hitting G every time we would hit that I'm gonna go back to F just so the main one is our something smaller rather than a ride but anyways this is we'll play around with it it's not really important the important thing here is to go to choose pitch so now if we go down four and we go up seven eight ten I think that was what we had 11 or something up there but this will work so now for each note it's going to randomly pick between four semitones down and send 10 semitones up so now let's hear this [Music] okay so that is obviously a complete mess but you get the point that it is then on each note it's going to be playing completely different uh sample so that's what we want and now what we want to do is we want to combine that with the density control so let's go ahead and activate the density here and then I'm just going to hit this let's put the density on something now I'll start up at 100 so you can hear it as we move down so let's go down to say like 10 percent there we go so now only each note has a 10 probability of playing and let's just go ahead and loop that go back so now you hear that we're getting random little accents coming through and this is exactly what we're looking for and so now what we can do is if I go to the audio inserts we want to delay now you could do a ping pong stereo multi-tab depends what you want I'm gonna go with the stereo delay here [Music] but just to show you here so we've got um that one half dotted and one quarter dotted and you can hear it and it's moving around so now let's just you know open this up and hear what it sounds like with the kicking base and everything [Music] okay so that's giving you a taste of what we want to do so what I'm going to do here is I'm actually because what we're doing is we're randomly creating these patterns so I'm not choosing which one is hit so some of them are going to be great and some of them are not going to be perfect so what we'll do here is we're just going to go to my bar setting and I'm just going to make this and we're going to just duplicate it a bunch so that we have a longer random part so now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to um we have I just wanted to show you I have a low cut on here just pulling out the low frequencies so you know because we want these as accents I'm just going to put a little lower for recording that way if we need it again we can have a separate one but let's just put it down here around 200 Hertz is fine because again these are going to be accents so even on the snare we don't want the bottom end I'm going to turn off the stereo delay because as I said it's going to randomly choose which hit is going to be you know which which drum will be hit at each um each time so some of them are going to be on some of them won't be exactly perfect and if there's delay then it's going to all mix together so we're going to just record it clean and then we can choose which ones we like and delete the rest and then add the delay after that so I'm just going to go to export here let's choose groov agent and let's say groov agent clean um 24 bits put it into the pool and create an audio track so it just brings it into the project for us okay so that has recorded and as you can see we have some hits so let's go ahead and mute that and now I'm going to put our stereo delay here or you know what we can try um uh let's try the H stereo delay a lot of people like this and let's see how this sounds and we can also put it on ping pong [Music] okay so this is sounding very good this is this is exactly what I'm talking about [Music] okay okay so then what we would do here is we would just find the ones that we don't like you know and then just to show an example maybe I don't want this one or it's not exactly where we want it so I'm just going to make um our waveforms look a little bit bigger so we can see easier so let's say that I so I'm just gonna gr I think that maybe these ones in the middle here aren't really helping us so let's just get we go to quantize in our 16th Note size and I'm just gonna get rid of these guys so that then have a little bit less and let's go over here so this one here too um we have this little accent and we probably don't need that for example so let's try that also I don't like that one these are good maybe a little too much here so we'll just mute it let's also put up our [Music] let's just put our uh EQ honest as well so I got a pro Q three is my default so just turn move that and so we keep the high frequencies but we can get a little bit of a roll off so we don't get too much there even if we want we can put a little bit lower here and I'm just going to pull this up because I don't want those Toms um too much [Music] and maybe these guys a little much too [Music] don't want that one you also can move them you know we don't just have to be deleting them [Music] so say maybe this guy here which you see is starting uh kind of on a weird place here um so what we could do is if we just separate these guys out and we could just move this into a different place [Music] so what I'm gonna do actually let's just let's switch these guys [Music] use number two oops and go back to our bar so that we're and I'm just gonna grab this guy and move them here and then this guy that I took over here let's put that on try that so that'll be [Music] [Music] uh so maybe not that one there you don't need too much I mean we're just trying to make a um you know an intro kind of thing and some accents around also we can do this you know if we go back here for example now we've got our delay and everything we can do different versions so now let's go back here let's maybe say make it um you know still low percentage but let's just switch this up we're going high a little bit let's just keep it retracted a little bit so maybe we only go down three and up five so now we're gonna have different hits coming through and we we can then um bounce this so let's do another one one and make a second recording and now let's see what this one looks like so you can see we've got a lot of different hits here and so let's just I'm just to you know duplicate our settings here I'm just going to move this up and then move it down to a new channel that will duplicate the settings on the other one we also could just put it on here and use the lanes but just for our purposes I just want to hear [Music] okay so we're getting a lot of so I think here if we go and I just mute and listen to this we might want to [Music] these crashes are kind of a lot maybe we don't need all these crashes and we'll leave the rise and the snare the actual snare sounds a lot like our other one so we'll leave the ghost we'll leave the snare open and we're gonna get rid of these guys so now I'm gonna open this back up to four and ten and so then now we're going to get all of them but sometimes we'll get you know empty space as well so let's try this again one more recording see what it looks like so clean two all right and now I had already this is the same channel from before with our delay so let's just make sure everything else is muted so we're not hearing it twice we can remove this Channel and let's hear [Music] so now we're not getting all those right I mean there's uh crashes in there as well and then of course you know another thing to be to do would be to automate um uh this uh delay so that we're not always having you know the same um the same things like if we just I'm just going to do it by hand right now so so that would be foreign [Music] just for an example and we could automate those or you could put them on multiple delays and we could have FX sends here I have a couple different you know delays on the ascends so we could be sending them to different delays whatever you want to do um you know and you can chop out the ones that you don't like and mix them in um different delays add a little Reverb whatever you want to do you can push some backwards but this is a really nice trick that I like to use to just develop just like when we're writing the um you know the synth lines and we want to have the part kind of you know you know bring out the ghost in the machine this is the same thing that we can let the randomness make a pattern for us and we might get some hits where we wouldn't otherwise think to put them and then we can move them around to get them exactly where we want but I really like to use this technique to add those little percussion accents and you could even do this also if you want with just you know with out doing a whole drum kit just a couple different drums and you know say three or four different drums that you want to go around or adjust your Toms or just your rides and a really nice way to create some rhythms with some different hits and you know these little accents so I'll just play it back from the beginning one more time on the second one that we have see what we hear and that'll be it [Music] so we're listening to this one now [Music] so all these ones sounded pretty good maybe you know for example this little one right here doesn't really add much so I would say you know if they're not adding get rid of them or if they're in weird places [Music] this one right on the first hit it's weird and now we'll hear with everything coming in see really nice little accents on top of the parts that are already there so that is it um just to go over it again basically what we're going to do here is create a find a sampler any sampler grab a drum kit or just a few different drum samples of different kinds um and then use your midi modifier and density trick so again we create just 16th notes so that we have every 16th note taken care of and put it somewhere within the range in the octave that the samples are and then go over to the midi modifiers and this time we'll be using the pitch set the Min and the max to the somewhere within the range of where the samples are and then put your density and put the density very low you know around 10 percent or lower maybe up to 15 depending on how many you want um so you don't get too many overlaps and then record then when you get into the audio uh you know delete any ones that are out of place move some edit it a little bit to get it exactly the way you want add your delay EQ Reverb and you're good to go so thanks a lot guys this was um cabion here teaching a percussion random midi modifier trick and I hope you guys enjoyed stay tuned for the next video thanks have a good day guys
