welcome everybody today I'm going to be talking about sample and hold random modulation in your Iraq I'm going to be showing off two modules the instru tag and the ssf ran step so thanks for joining please if you like the video like And subscribe and let's Jump Right In okay so the first module that I'm going to show you is this the instrument type and so this is a great sample and hold module with really cool also display that is going to be perfect for showing um how it works and the various things that we can do um with sample and hold so the first thing I'm going to do is just plug in the output of this into um this scope up here the mordax data that way we can see what's happening and then we'll start to um oh then the other thing then I will do is I'm going to turn on this we're going to use the intro neoni and I have it coming out the wave folder envelope I mean our output and so if I turn the volume up on this we just have a tone okay so now I'll just turn it down for a second while we talk so this is the time it has its own built-in clock so that you can with slow and fast modes and or you can feed it in a clock right and then this is the output and this is the noise so it's got inside it like a pink noise um thing to that drives the random so if we turn the amount up here the level and then we start going with the clock the internal rate we can see that we are getting step patterns and now if I plug the output through the scope into the one volt per octave so this way we can hear what's happening so we can get different values and then here's the slow so that's as fast as it goes on the slow mode and then you can get really super fast here okay now the other thing that we have is bipolar or unipolar so for example here with the uh in bipolar mode right now it's going to be choosing values on both sides above and below whatever the rate is the I mean the value that it's set at now and then if it goes to unipolar it'll only be one side so you and you can see corresponding the color here underneath is orange okay now the other thing that we have is slew and so you can see that this rounds off so basically what sample and hold is is what we're saying is it grabs its samples one value and it will hold that until it's told it gets another impulse like from the clock that it should find another value and so exactly like if we slow it down right you see that it's holding for a long or well yeah yeah because the clock here so it's longer right and if we even go to the slow one say see see getting it holds the value until it gets the next thing all right so super fast so that is the basics of what sample and hold is doing but with a module like this we can actually um do a lot more and get a we can okay so what we do is we can put it in LFO into this in right so I have an LFO right here this is the oct from instro and so if we go to the input here and then um the volume so if you see what happens here it's now and if I make the LFO faster right [Music] so if I make it really fast you can see that it's now following the triangle of the um get from the lso and so then an attempt right here so each time it gets a clock it will put the value it'll hold that where it is in the wave form right so slower right more Steppy but as you can see it's always following the triangle pattern right so that's pretty cool and we can then you know you get a different feel by if we go see so we're getting like chromatic steps almost [Music] right [Music] okay so now what we can also do is if we use a more complex waveform not just I mean LFO so not just a triangle if you see up here I have the bitumi and this is running in Quad road so the first these other three will control um divisions of the um of the of the it's well hey let me just show you what's happening it'll be easier than just describing it so if we go to two I'm going to turn on this blue one actually let's use the yellow one uh four okay so now if I take [Music] so if I show you here [Music] let's turn this off for a second and oh I put in two and I'm putting four okay so the yellow one here I can turn this off as well the yellow one this is our our wave form on this LFO right so I'm at the sign and you can see it's a sun right but once I start moving these right you see then how it's changing the waveform and if we move then you can get different all kinds of different crazy waveforms like this right so as you can see we're able to get you know a little bit more Dynamic variating um LFO then just a straight triangle and that's going to be so now I'll take that and we can actually just leave that so you can see we can see both at the same time now if we put this into the input here right so now if I turn on the visibility of this and now see this is really helpful way to see you can see the now if I increase the the rate right or it's to decrease the race you see so this is very clearly showing how at each point whenever it gets it's making that value and holding it the next time so it's following the waveform and [Music] and so you get here you're seeing it kind of getting these cool patterns almost like arpeggios um come into it and so this is actually something that we can do is make some pretty cool arpeggios using this so what we're going to want to do is before we go straight in to the uh in serum should I need longer ah too long okay so if we take the our LFO oh it's actually no it's doing it right so we put that in here and then we take the output right and the output of our sample and hold we're going to use with a quantizer and it could be any quantizer but I'm going to show you the onc um which is this ornaments and crime a micro custom well just you know some small Builder made it but these are really great because has a ton of different um modes here and for trig and CV and outs for each right so there's one like quadrature which is four lfos which is cool but this one we're going to use quantumane okay and so now um wait this is going to be the or output and need a little short guy and then we take we go into the CV from the output okay so now I think you can see that yep okay so now what we do is um we can choose scale right so use refine semitone phrygian um you know lots of different scales here all kinds of stuff you can put your own in as well and so let's just choose for example like phrygian right we've got a root of G so then what we could do is tune our oscillator to one of these now so now if I I'm going to let's go into three here so that we can see we can tune and see the waveform so I'm just going to pop this guy through as well okay so now if I go to tuner mode in this and we go to three so now also I'm just going to take this out for a sec just so that here if you all right so let's tune to a g okay close enough so now we go back to oscilloscope mode okay and now if we plug in back our one volt per octave we are now in phrygian and uh I so here if we go in we also can choose which notes are active so this is every note in the scale [Music] right so this is a cool thing is that now what if we just take out some of these notes so we have like four right [Music] so now you can see we're getting these kind of cool and if we reduce the amount a bit you can also turn on this so you can see [Music] the time is it's all right we don't need to see so [Music] we're just going higher right see so getting really cool arpeggios that's kind of changing and that's just by running the LFO into the sample and hold and going through a quantizer so now I want to we want to make this a bit more complex so and make a little bit of a deeper sound and then add some more uh sample and hold and I will show you using the r d step as well now there's one other thing that I didn't cover yet um on this which is that we could run a clock in instead of just doing it um by itself and I'm going to do that now so that then we can have this ran step also be clocked the same as the intro so what I can what we do then is just run I have this MMS quad clock distributor which if I was running to connect it to the Daw um I it would have the clock coming from your midi module and then into here but um since I'm not having a clock to the computer we have a tap ability here so we can just tap a Tempo and then choose the divisions of it so I just made a tab Tempo and now we can see that this is at that Tempo so now this is not doing anything foreign and then one other thing to show you is this Holden Track which is an inverted track and hold that has a bit of a different character because as you said instead of sampling holding it holds and tracks and you can kind of see how it's different [Music] see [Music] instead of [Music] so anyways you can get some interesting results from that little microtone kind of things in there some it's fun to play with all right so now let's make this more bad ass so the first thing is um what I'm gonna do is we're in the wave fold output right so let's modulate that with sample and hold so what we're going to do is just like we're clocking this instrument from the Quad clock distributor we take the next one and we are going into the Rand step now this is a really cool module it is super Compact and packed with features so basically or functionality really it's got three okay for each thing this is the trigger so you put in like a clock or a trigger input you can put three separate ones or just this one and then they're all being triggered or clocked by that and you see that there are different divisions the left hand side of each one is unipolar and then the right one here is bipolar and the right one can also have a sample input so like an LFO that we had there we could run that into this one and then so you could have um basically six different stable and hold random outs from this tiny little 4 HP module and yeah it's just great you know it's just in so you know like we're gonna do it right now you can add quickly a bunch of modulation that's all slightly different timings but all clocked together and instead of having you know three or four different sampling whole modules you got this one for Workhorse Duty and then I'm using the intro to have a little bit more um control over certain things and this one is just a little more you know plug it in and go so let's let's try so now what we're going to do is we're going to take let's try um this bipolar one and we plug it into the CV here and then turn this up or if we're going to unipole right and so now you can see it [Music] there we go you can feel gone [Music] see that one okay and then plug this one back in [Music] okay so we're getting a little extra modulation there now what I want to do is also get some FM with the neoni so I'm going to take another output let's just take triangle is fine and we're gonna okay this is from the CSL and everything's also I'm just going to use this top oscillator and I'm going to plug it into here and now if we turn up the FM amount right all right that's pretty cool but now what I want to do is I actually am going to put it into uh through zero mode and so this is going to flip which is the carrier and which is the modulator so in order to tune it we're going to then have to tune this so if I just pop this over into let's go number two for now and I go back to the tuner and go to two so now we just want to tune this guy to G okay um close enough okay and then now we plug this in to the FM and now I'm going to switch to true zero okay okay [Music] and then remove that okay and then the other thing is now you're hearing this [Music] it's not changing the pitch anymore because that would be this one right so now this is just giving us this through zero Amber which I love awesome and then [Music] okay so that's pretty cool for now so now let's keep pumping away on this guy let's take another one of its outputs um doesn't matter we can take take try this or the this one maybe and now if we go back into the vulper Octave of the neoni so this is going to be then the one that's controlling basically like the Timbre of the sound so right so now if you like I'm moving then right so we find a nice spot now the only thing is is there's no way to control the attenuation of it it's just fully in right there so this is a good opportunity to use a VCA so if I just run the this output here into VCA and then I can control the amount um let's go back to our oscilloscope so we can see everything happening all right so now I can bring in this one like that so now this is this and this are all getting sampled in the whole modulation [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay I like that [Music] okay and so now another thing that we could do is let's take another and go to even something else so what we could do is go into the wave fold of this right and then take another one of these [Music] and the same thing I'm gonna go through oh this one [Music] so one of the cool things here is that if we want to modulate this we have our attenuator already in here so what we can do is just go directly from let's say this one in to here and put the wave fold in the middle and then okay [Music] understanding of time [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so that's pretty cool and then now just to show if we were to run this through um some kind of an envelope so we can use the instruments which is up here and so what we want to do then is we need the clock as well and so if we take another one the third output of our quad clock distributor and we come over here and we put it it to this which is our adsr and then we're going to use what we can do into so you can see this there's another there's a VCA so if we take the output the CV out and that goes to our CVN and then we just run the signal through our VCA and I'm gonna just take it out here because we don't need to see the waveform like that okay so now we have an envelope right [Music] and this is what I want to do now let's randomly modulate the release time [Music] so with this one I am going to then use uh we can use say the do we want bipolar we can just try yeah we want unipolar actually so but we'll use this one into the input make sure the CV is turned off and it is linear because we're running a signal through not applying something to it and so then oh it's barely not long enough okay so now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right [Music] okay and now we've showed I'm going to just take out the one thing that's controlling the volts per octave right which is our first one that we're doing so now we just get straight and then what I'm gonna do is take that which is where'd it go oh it's a split one here so what we're going to do now is I'm going to go through a filter right so um we can go I'm gonna do well just so you can hear it a lot I'm going to go through this the Q pass um and so this one is stereo so if we just take the output here into that and then we this is the frequency cut off and the CV input there and then I just need to these guys and it's a little hard but we can take the band pass just so you can really hear what's happening so now right [Music] and this has this is called radiation okay right so now so the filter and then now I'm just going to tune it higher so we get a nicer [Music] there you go [Music] what's up there we go what's up and now as you see we're not making an arpeggio but we're just using it to control all these pictures [Music] thank you [Music] and if I just you know we want to take actually [Music] we just have to put the all the notes back in [Music] and then also we can take it off this and just do like semitone because it's running this [Music] so it doesn't need to be pitched let me just take it out but I don't feel like doing it so [Music] all right so just uh to summarize as you can continue seeing um here if you remember from the beginning that we have used the sample and hold from the intro tie to First make a kind of arpeggiated style by running an LFO into it and then running that through a um the quantizer and affecting the pitch of the oscillator then we've also used the sample and holds various outputs from the Rand step and then also the instru as well on other parameters that are just taking CVS instead of volts per octave and so these are just modulating various things of the param of parameters of the synths we were doing the two wave folds the voltage proactive amount of the second oscillator which is changing the Timbre of the FM and then we also put it on a the cutoff of a band pass and another one on the release time of an envelope and so you can see that it's a really really great way to add some life to your patches and as I said I really enjoy this for HP ran step because it's super small there's another one that div kid um had to hand in also with the oct so you've been collaborating with the urac manufacturers but as you can see we've got four we're using four different sample and hold outputs just sending one thing in one trigger whereas you know this is three times no one yeah at least three times the size and it's just a single out but as I said you get a little bit more control because you can dial things in a bit you've got the level in here and it looks cool but uh so I really like these two in combination with each other and I hope that this was uh useful if you guys have any questions please uh add them in the comments if you like this video please like And subscribe so you can keep making more and uh yeah thanks for sticking around see you next time
