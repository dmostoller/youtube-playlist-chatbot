hey everybody we are back and this is going to be the second video in these um pigments series and so this time we're gonna just go use what we learned in the last one and quickly make a similar sound that I was working on there we're just going to go straight through it so the first thing I have here we're in the wave table section I've created a new patch and I'm going to put this so that we get to the saw wave and so we have a saw we're going to put up some FM and then if we go down we get our tone and just wanted one thing I didn't mention here is we can on the modulator for the FM we can choose the wave type here so if we wanted to have a saw wave we can do that so this is gonna so we have a saw mixed with another saw and so then we're going to Route it to the filter and we're going to put the band pass here and put the resonance up and move this down a bit okay so now if this is moving around so first thing I'm going to use is our note length and midi um technique like we did before so let's go ahead and put it on and remember we have the length here and the density here let's see what happens great so what I wanted to show here one thing I forgot before is so if we put I'm going to put sample and hold here so if we go to random 2 which is our sample and hold the trigger is coming from the clock and so if we click random two we'll put it here this is going to move around now the tri the clock is giving the trigger right now one thing that I didn't mention before but what we can do is we could put the mono keyboard as the um Source instead of the clock so now if I hit a key it's going to do it so if we hit play [Music] now it's moving every single time there's a note so this is like the note on random in serum so if we do like that then I'm going to take the LFO and it's now let's have the clock or free running on the reset it's synced and so if we turn the timing down a little bit and then we put [Music] there we go so now we're going to put the LFO [Music] and we'll just put this onto say the we can put a little FM Mount so we get a little bit of movement on the FM [Music] foreign [Music] okay and then let's go to the FX section turn on the delay [Music] you can get a little Reverb so now I want to go instead and show you guys using the um we're going to use the sequencer instead so we're going to turn off these things and then instead of the mono keyboard Source here let's go ahead and put it on um sorry this is onto random the clock Source instead to be the actual clock and then we'll go over to the sequencer turn it on and put it to 16th notes and then we'll get some Randomness on our length and probability [Music] then we're going to use the binary here which I showed you guys before and we're going to put the binary amount going on to [Music] sometimes because [Music] [Music] and then let's go back to the synth let's turn on another filter this one will be um some resonance and we'll put a high pass put it down and we'll put lfo1 to this and then we will put our um binary also to go so if we have the random three also binary and we're going to put this here so [Music] [Applause] [Music] and if we were to put a little wave folding or something too we look at it in two day [Music] [Applause] and we have a nice basic thing going on here and sounds really nice [Music] so just wanted to show you guys that basically taking the lessons we used on the last one and just making a very simple patch that is moving around a bit got some nice movement on it and using combination of these lfos and the random now also again we've talked about the combinance so what if we try to mix these two lfos instead of moving at different speeds so if we put the two lfos here and now you see that and we could put this on our um on this instead so instead of going lfo2 oh sorry this one we can leave instead of lfo1 going to the filter 2 cut off we get rid of that and we'll go to our com one and we'll put that here so now it's moving a little bit differently and let's go back [Music] [Music] foreign guys so I just wanted to show you a quick little thing of using pigments uh based on what we did last time to make one little simple thing this is kind of what I was working on and so you can see how easy it is to just route something using a few different things and make a really nice lead and you could use either the note length and density tool or the built-in sequencer to get a nice result and so this one just following off that last one and tomorrow I'm going to make another video and we'll get on showing some of the other features we'll use some of the other modes and make some different sounds and so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and stick with me for future lessons in arturia pigments thanks guys and have a good one
