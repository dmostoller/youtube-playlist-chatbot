um we don't need this it's just a ruler track okay so what I'm doing here is I'm putting my um I put some I have my channel that I'm working on I have a bunch of reference tracks right um and so I'm using my own music on this but like for you guys I would recommend to you know if you're making a track that's you know full-on or something pick a top full-on artist and use that as a reference track if you're making night music or dark tie or Forest pick a track that sounds you know like what you want it to sound like and just use that as a reference again you don't need to sound it exactly like that but it'll be a good point for checking your metering especially when you're trying to figure you know you're learning um but and then what I do is I usually I take one of my good ones and I just keep mastering all my other ones to that so that you know even if it's not perfect it's consistent um and uh yeah so then what I'll do is I'll put some meters and stuff onto the master so that way I can look and I can see the master Channel but also I get so if I'm so but I'll leave is this one unsolowed and then the other one so let's see I can switch between them and then see everything right so I can be checking out so let me just turn down a little bit more because now we're doing um but exactly so if I put the if I put all the um Scopes and stuff onto the individual Channel then you're just going to see if that one channel I want to see the same Scopes across all of the different tracks so I can just check out my reference tracks and that and then you're also listening and you just type you know do that switch back and forth and make sure they are in the right place um okay so for mastering I would say when especially when you're doing it for your guys yourself there's a bunch of you know if we were talking about how did it get you to do like to professional mastering there would be many stages there's a lot of different types of things you can use but for our purposes we're not you know in your you to really Master well you also need um your room to be treated better you need to understand how your speakers sound um you know in reference to other speakers and you know there's a lot of knowledge there and that um you know takes time to gain and so I think it's really worthwhile to you know get somebody to master your tracks personally I pay if you know with the tracks to get released everything on sangoma goes through somebody and so they eventually will pay for it but for me if the track is not going to come out for six months or who knows when it's going to come out I'll just pay for scorp to master it's not cheap but that way everything in my set is all mastered and when I'm playing out all the time I mean that's how I play out so I want it master it properly not just on the CD for other people to play but at the same time I don't want to I don't want to master the track before it's finished so a lot of times I'll finish finish a track you know get it ready to play and I want to do a quick mastering to get it so that it's close enough to my actually mastered stuff that I can play it out in my set and it sounds pretty good so that's what we're going to talk about not professional mastering but you know a home mastering uh that will allow you to get it close enough to you know play with with other properly mastered stuff so there are a few um the the mo the first thing that you're doing in you know which is the last step last stage in it but it's the most important one would be a limiter and to be honest um you could only use the limiter and actually it wouldn't go so wrong because the other thing to think about mastering your own music is you know you just wrote it so it's hard to be really objective about it you know if you send it to somebody else or even if you were listening to somebody else's music you'd be like oh there's not enough bass there's too much of this there's too much of that and fix it but if it's your own track well you're gonna think it's right because you just did it and then if you do notice something wrong well it would be better to actually since you have the project to go back and fix it rather than try to like like if you say oh that sound is you know this EQ or the percussion is not loud enough you wouldn't want to just boost the percussion it's still super loud guys sorry um you wouldn't just want to boost oh that's why it went all the way up sorry negative 15 please there we go so if you see something wrong and that the percussion is too loud or too low or whatever you wouldn't want to just say put an EQ and pull this down or push that up it's your music go back to the track fix it and then put it back in so I highly suggest that using your mastering process to catch the last things but then don't overdo it the mastering engineer that you send it to they'll do that kind of stuff but for our own purposes it'd be easier to fix any things you notice in your mix and then put it back through so that you could almost just do a very clean mix clean you know uh as I mean um simple mastering and even I heard um there's this some I don't know Armin Van Buren maybe or somebody like that he was talking about that when he makes when he was ready to play something out to test it before it's finished to make sure that it's good he'll just throw this one on it which is the uad Precision limiter but it really doesn't it doesn't have to be this one we can also I want to pull up um Pro l it doesn't look like that which is Fab filters and then if we want we can also talk about let's see if the if we go into um in Cubase there's gonna they have brick wall limiter and also just limiter we'll just show what a limiter would look like but so basically what a limiter is going to do any of these we can start with like the pro l you're gonna give it gain right so you're going to be pushing the audio signal up and then it's going to cut everything that goes over the threshold so you're going to be and oh this is where we want to talk about um decibels versus RMS so decibels is a measure of the peak loudness so that the uh at the loudest Peak that you have at any given moment is going to be a decibel value then you have another thing called RMS and RMS is uh the root mean Square and so this is the it's the square root of the mean Square basically what it does is it gives you a generalized and averaged mean so this is your um you know the average level uh it's it's kind of like the body of the sound if you think it's how much it's really going to how much pressure is going to be there and this is what you're really pushing up we're going to be pushing the RMS because the decibels at some point the Peaks are going to be hitting zero or above and anything above zero is going to be squashed and we are going to be pushing the RMS up underneath that and so the more you push it the more squash it's going to be and as we can just see if we do this as we go up it's reducing the sound here oh thanks babe coffee delivery um and so it's going to be cutting it and the difference in a compressor it's going to be a bit smoother this is going to literally allow nothing to go above it and there are different modes for them um where you know on some I have on the Oxford one which is really great they also make this that's not for uad the sonox Oxford limiter they have some things like a safe mode an auto comp which just deal with the way that that deals with the very top so sometimes you'll get a master track that still goes into the red and so this safe mode will deal with that this one also has a little pre-process and an enhanced curve which is very nice but the general thing is basically the same that you're going to be pushing the gain of the track up and it's going to be limiting what's there and so to be honest for most practical purposes this is what I just do to my tracks when I want to play it out because as I said if I'm applying why why put an EQ on there when I could just fix it in the track why put you know some other multi-band compressor while those things all can be good again you know I'm listening to this sound on the same speakers that I wrote it on and so it's going to be different difficult for me really to add much to it at that in that process so for my own purposes you can you know you can just put a limiter on there and the limiter will do a good job and but we'll go through also some of the other things just so you can see what what happens um so for example um types of other things you could use would be a multi-band this one is a from universal audio it's part of their mastering series but again there are many things like this there are a lot you know and also let me pull this up what's it called um oh right ozone so let's talk about ozone uh oh I didn't install it again anyways I I forgot to it's not here not sure why I have the isotope um their meter thing which is also very good um because the other thing we can talk about is luffs right luffs so here let's show what happens on let's show what happens when we just put this so we're going to use these this one sorry Windows here this is a meter and we'll go to our thing and just put push it up on the pro l ol so we have two things we have um levels here and so what you can see is you can see the top line is going to be the peak and then we are also going to have the um uh RMS right and then we have luffs and so there are three different ways and so the basically the way that the difference between RMS is RMS is going to be individually like at that moment it's hitting this RMS level the Lux is going to be a uh another um over a period of time it's going to be so here you see momentary Max loss which will show us and then the integrated lust was good it's going to be over time so you can see um and so this will just be give you it's two different two different types of ways of monitoring it and that you want to kind of think about them both usually you don't want your left to go over negative eight and same thing with your um RMS for other musics it can be different you know again here there's you don't want there's the What's called the loudness Wars where everybody's been pushing the RMS and The Lofts up um but there's a point where it's just going to sound worse if you ever listen to something like you know Progressive house they're going to be hitting it's going to be much more they're going to have higher RMS and everything but that's because it's a different music and they have less stuff going on if it were rock and roll they would have a bigger dynamic range which would mean a lower um like negative 14 decibels for the uh for the um all right RMS so anyways there's rules there's also if we look here I have this precision limiter which you can see there are different types of monitoring if I turn it on this one is cool because it it is a limiter so we can limit it here but one of the reasons I also like it is because we have different modes so there's these K modes which are basically standardized to different ranges so it'll put zero as net is actually negative 20. K12 would be 12 as the top of the bar negative 12 and k 14 would be 14 is the top so that way the top of the meter is right and so basically K20 was for like movies and stuff k14 was generally for music rock and roll K12 is for broadcast like radio and stuff like this but again that's a bit outdated but it's still a good I mean those our music we go above that so we would want like a k9 but they don't make that so um anyways but you could see if you're going above then the zero point then you would know so we could also see it in just Peak and RMS and in here we have a zoom option so you can see it so if I hit play again this is our Peaks and this is the RMS so so this is a good limiter but at the same time you guys don't need that like you talked constant loudmasters yes exactly so this is the thing it's also you know if you ever listen to T if you're watching TV and you're watching a movie or something and then a commercial comes on you're like what the it's so loud that's because they have compressed the they're limited the  out of that advertisement so that it's like really loud and um yeah in the in there's been is this trend that everybody was trying to make their mastering louder so but again it's apparent loudness there's a difference between actual volume loudness and apparent loudness so something seems louder but it's not actually louder there's a maximum range also loudness is determined by your speakers you know if you turn your speakers down it's quieter right so it's not actually a measure of how loud it is it's a measure of how loud it seems right and so if you just push stuff up together it's going to seem louder but also it's gonna You're Gonna Lose a dynamic range and for our music dynamic range is very important also the constant loudness is important so you have to get a balance of that um so let's just look here at the we're not going to use the Precision one because I want to show you guys stuff so this is isotope Insight um and then just the pro out so here we're getting our um so we have yep you can see here this is the range and then this is the top there so average and if we push it up now we've got it that the that you see the top is hitting is at zero or above right because this is we need to turn on they need a safe mode or something here but it's getting all the way to the top and then this is going to be showing us our RMS levels down here this as you can see we have the momentary Lofts and then the integrated left and so the integrated left is a great way to do it because it's going to take your sound and over a few seconds and as everything's adding up and give you a nice balanced one so this is the one that you don't really want to go above eight negative eight um but again an eight negative nine somewhere in this range is where you want to be all right so that's already getting us into the levels we want now what I would do is just to show you to with to level it out what we're going to do is just I want to a b it against some other um tracks that I already have mastered so let's listen oh and actually sorry I was saying with the RMS you don't really want to go above negative with with the integrated left so you could go up as high as like negative seven and a half negative seven it depends also again some tracks if they have more mid-range and stuff you'll see the balance of RMS to Lost is different than something that is more open and so these are not rules as much as guidelines okay [Music] so those are kind of a different example because as you can hear the bass in this phase change one is um sounds totally different and this one's sitting a lot lower so a little bit of a hard comparison and maybe we can try a different one [Music] foreign sound different but our levels are staying the same basically between them and so that is giving us that means that we're in close range and their levels are about right where we want them to be if we did it like this and we hear this and we're down here and also if you just click this it resets so obviously this can be too quiet so we're still getting it louder when we do it to the other one so I would say I need a little more so somewhere around there would be good and again one other thing I'll mention is that in my masters when I usually can't uh thanks guys yeah more coming soon uh but when I do my own mastering also I can't quite get it as loud and uh as loud as say scorp does without compressing it a bit too much so usually I'll just leave it a little bit lower you know I won't squash it if mine sounds and like The Lofts are a little bit lower that's fine because then on the mixer I'll just be aware and I might gain it up I just find that if I push too hard and I try to exactly match um the mastering then you might squash it too much and it would be a little better to have a little more dynamic range and then gain it up if you need to while you're playing your set then to over squash it and again the professional matching Engineers are going to have better equipment and everything so they'll be able to get a cleaner result with more pumping um but right so you don't necessarily need you know don't try to exactly match whatever your track is get close to it and a little under it just because you know you're never going to be able to do as good as the professional Master did on your own system so now I just want to show you a couple of the other types of things I would use um if I was doing some mastering for somebody else or if I wanted if I decided I wanted to tweak things a bit more and have some more control so there's a few different things you can use um as I said this Precision multiband this one I really like this is pretty cool because uh and there are others that do this this is I got a uad Precision mastering series when I first got my uad and it came with a couple basic ones the great thing about this is it is multi-band but it has the option to be a compressor expander and gate so you can choose different modes so you can either expand or compress and so this is nice because sometimes you might want to expand a bit say the high frequencies but compress something else so if I hit this one you can see that it has three types of modes here and so I can put this one if I wanted to compress it and let me turn it on so now you can see we're compressing the low frequencies a little bit and you don't really want this you don't really want to compress when the kick is hitting but this could be useful if there's something that's stepping onto the kick a little bit you know so um and then you can see it's going down for compression and this one is expanding so here I have it on the expander and if we listen to the high frequencies you can also mute enable and everything or solo so we can just hear different parts of it and tools like this can be really useful to hear and to just change things and so sometimes when I'm doing a little masking for somebody else if the percussion is too low you can expand it a little bit if you have some mid-range stuff that's hitting too much you can compress it the other thing to do is if say you wanted to you know boost part of the track and not you know like the high frequencies you wouldn't want to put a parametric EQ on the entire mix because it's just going to affect the frequencies next to what you're doing so what you can this is a good way also if you just say I need a little bit more mids you could just bring it up with a multi-band because the way that these crossovers are going to work is just make it a little bit cleaner and so you won't affect the frequencies down here when you're boosting it here so as you can see we can boost the frequencies if we wanted here and it's just going to be a little bit more subtle and a little bit more smooth so multi-band compression and stuff like this can be a useful tool then just to show you some things that people use that that are going to give you a better result is this is an EQ that I would use this special mastering EQ they also make a normal non-mastering version but this is called the manly massive passive it's based on a hardware thing that is you know renowned for mastering and so this one basically it's you can either make it stereo so each side is if I move this it's moving on both sides basically you just have a couple points that you choose to bandwidth here the frequency how if again oh sorry this is the frequency the bottom and so you choose the place where it is um you have low pass and high pass here mastering ones if you want so if you needed a low pass or high pass these would be very good ways to do it and then you have individual ones in this you can see they're different their shelves or uh if you if it's a shelf right then it would look like that and just different um this is the the bandwidth or the queue the frequency sorry the resonance uh so again at the bottom you would want to be using sharper ones up here you'd want to use smaller wider ones but this can be a good way if you wanted to boost or cut sometimes if we need a little more hi-hat and you could be boosting so you can hear more air more percussion up there but this kind of tool can be very good if you want to tweak your stuff a little bit um and it's something that I would use when I'm doing mastering for other people the next thing that I would use is uh so to talk about something else is that in so again for our own purposes if I'm just Mass the track to play out on the weekend I might just do the limit arm you know because again I wrote the track what am I going to do but um just to see what people are really doing there's another important thing to mastering which is called gain staging and so this can help you to basically instead of putting the limiter not that one instead of putting the limiter and having it go up 12 decibels or something like that you would get the each stage of the way you would be slowly boosting the volume so here in this I could put that in and I could put the gain up a little bit to give a one one decibel coming out of this um then I could use what this is called the Shadow Hills mastering compressor it's a dual compressor so it's I'm going to use it in Stereo mode but you could have it in mono cool thing about this one is it has two different types of circuits one is an optical and one is a discrete and this is just you know this is just algorithms in the computer but in the actual box um the this is modeled on there are different types of circuits and discrete using discrete Electronics Optical is using an optical circuit so uh they both have slightly different results so what we can do here though that this is really useful because it'll apply subtle compression before we go to the um to the limiter so that can give us a little bit of shaping the sound and help also as we do it gain stage our way up so I have the threshold here and then the gain so if we turn this on I'm getting a little bit of here and then what I can do is I can give it some gain which will then go into the next one and then we could gain it up here if we need to [Applause] much and one thing here when you're doing in mastering compression you want long attack times you see here the attack time is on 30 because basically you don't want to be squashing any of the Peaks and stuff you want to be subtly pushing it up right so you want long attack time on this which is what we can choose here on the discrete also the lower the ratio is the less the more transparent it's going to be so if you just want it to be very very subtle and use it as a boost you could put the ratio down to 1.2 so it's only gonna it's gonna be very small or you can put a bit higher two three wouldn't want to go all the way you want to keep it usually on the lower end but the most important thing is that the attack is going to be long on any mastering compression but again as you can see now if we do this and we look at our levels here when we put this on we're gaining some volume already so now when we go to our Fab filter we don't need to go up to Pro to 10 anymore we could probably do something around eight I don't really need to apply you don't need to um put the gain on the limiter up very much some people would even do it so by the time it's gotten to the limiter it's all the way up there and it's just catching the Peaks and stuff but this is a good tool because then you're going to shape it as it goes up and each step of the way so it's going to be more transparent if you don't have giant boosts like this um so that's just something to know again it's less important when we're doing our own home mastering but just to know the way that the people who are professionally mastering it they're going to be doing that stepping the gain up with each step of the way anyways um and then let me just show you so you can see um that um what this this limiter does well here we can uh if I there's one other tool here this is called a maximizer and it looks just like the other one but what this is going to do is it's basically a it's got a shape here and a mix and it's going to be shaping the sound and adding if you look at it it adds little ridges almost to the uh to the waveform right and so this is basically in um in the analog world you know when you say something's warmer this is kind of what it's doing um and this obviously is not analog and you don't want to do a lot of this because it will really change the sound but very subtly this can put you know make it sound a little bit brighter a little bit more full um and the one reason I really love this Oxford EQ or limiter from uh um uad but also they you know this is you can get this one by it not through the Oxford plugins are available in a bunch of different ones but it has this enhanced curve so first if we just listen to the master again so we're seeing the level here and the amount of gain reduction here [Applause] now we're going to listen what happens when I push this enhanced curve up so this is going to be doing a very similar thing to the max maximizer which is just enhancing The Sound by overlaying it with um something that's going to then just make it a little and you'll just hear if you listen carefully while we do this so as you can see it says here if we hover over it Dynamic enhancement and uh it's you know affecting each individual sample so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's down now the key to here is as you can see it's not changing the Lofts very much because you're not actually pushing it anymore you're not increasing the range but you can hear that it sounds Fuller right how it sounds uh more dynamic or more not Dynamic but more it sounds Fuller it sounds like you squashed a more brighter exactly everything and so this is a really useful tool and so some of these if they have the enhanced built in then it's great and I would not use a maximizer if they don't have it we can try it with the maximizer here which was this one you would put it um and so this one right anyways if we just listen to the shape and then I'll move the mix up [Applause] all right [Music] so that's down and you can see it sounds Fuller and brighter and again but again you don't want to do this all the way on the maximizer I use it there's you know the preset there says is it on because it's just really subtle because if you do this too much especially if it's after the limiter then you know you're going to be pushing you're going to be changing it and then you also might get Peaks above it but this is a useful tool so that you can make it sound more full sound brighter without over squashing it because you don't want to over squash your music um and then because then what's going to happen is people think that you you can push it up and it'll just be louder and louder but there's a point where you won't be any louder you're actually that's going to be hitting the compressor and it's going to duck the sound more and so it'll sound like it was depressed you know you hear these little bounds and that just means the music was over over limited over compressed and so you just want to watch out for that and that's why these enhanced things are really great um but again you know even the big boys the pros a lot of times we'll just put the limiter on and Pro is great I mean any basically any clean limiter you have is it's going to be great um and you know just put it on take a reference track and get it to you know approximately the right level and you know test it out because again as I said if you're mastering your own music it's hard to make the appropriate changes because you wrote it uh let's see here okay so that is the basics of mastering again the purpose of this is for you know you want to you make something and you want to compare it to something else you want to play it out you want to play it but I still recommend you know eventually when you're ready you know send a track to a professional masking engineer and pay them to do it and then you can compare that to your own and then also if you get one mastered then you can use that track as your reference track when you're doing your own mastering rather than somebody else's music because of course it's always going to be closer but for the now for the moment you guys I would you know and also if you look at the waveform with the analyzers or not I mean look at the waveform but also look at the Spectrum the the frequency analyzer you know you can compare to your favorite music you know so if you really see that you know your favorite music is how somebody you know your favorite artist has uh their percussion is much higher than yours well then you'll be able to see that clearly and you can make those corrections but again I'd go back into the project and fix it that way
