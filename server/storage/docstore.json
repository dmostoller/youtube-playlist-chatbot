you to all my sustaining members here for your patience I know it's been a little bit uh slow getting new videos up I just want to show you that I will be getting them out uh much more regularly um in the future so thank you again for your support today's video is an overview of the arturia pigments soft synth a lot of you guys probably familiar with serum which is great um and there's tons of videos and things out there I uh got pigments earlier this year and it's become my favorite soft synth so if you've used serum this will be in a way similar but there's going to be some great features here uh that I'm going to walk you through today that really make it excel in my mind for the type of music that I make for scitrance and this kind of um you know psychedelic sounds and the main thing that I really love about it is this routing Matrix here in the middle which we'll get to but just like there's a lot of a lot of variety in different sources for modulation and um that's what we really want so the first thing here is just to give you guys a little bit of an overview uh let me just go here we make a new preset so this is going to initialize it so we just have sine wave now the first thing to show you here is that this is we see we have engine 1 and engine two there's a few different modes here you can have it analog which is just you know the real basic analog setup with three different oscillators and you can choose the different waveforms you can then choose one to be you can make them FM to each other um and then you have the mix the volumes here you also have noise and then this modulation which is adding the oscillator 3 and the amount of noise then you also have here if we go we have wave table now this is going to be the best one I think for what we're doing and if you look here so then this one has FM here we have our Unison and tune still over there we have phase modulation phase Distortion and wave folding so these are all really really cool you can just see I'm just if we just put these up you see that this is linear FM yeah so just from a plain sine wave right in uh then here if we were to go we also have exponential to get a different type of FM sound to show you what phase mod would look like let me get this right then we also have phase distortion which is going to change the shape of the waveform and then you have different targets here so different types of shaping of phase distortion so these will all give different sounds and also if you put them in con combination say with FM you're going to see with shaping the waveform a lot here so these can be put together to give you a lot of different types of sound we also then here have wave folding and then again the shape [Music] so also a really killer tone here so this is just you know basically just from a normal sine wave and then we have all of these different characteristics different types of sounds and there's three different modes of wave folding here this one's going to give us the most definition which for our purposes will sound the best so again we have the phase Distortion phase modulation frequency modulation and wave folding now again look what happens if we mix these things together Just Killer I mean we get such great tones and this is all again just from the basic waveform of a saw of a sine wave now just to show you if we were this is so wait we have a wave folder here then if we go up here it comes with lots of different waveforms built in so we have different things here if you come you'll see different waveforms there are also natural some things like a French horn or a guitar there are processed ones there are synthesizers so like Basics send things say micro boot they're going to be from other artoria things different waveforms here transform ones which are then going to have um uh wait and then also to show you in 3D here what this is a key important part is that we have the position of a wave table here that we can scroll through and if you look at in 3D you will see what's going on so this is similar to serum if you've used it before and even if we just go back to the building waves basic waveforms just to start here you see that if we in our 2D right as we scan through we're going to have square triangle sine saw and then if we go to 3D obviously we'll see that there and you can drag through by putting your cursor here as well so so let's so let's just take us just to keep going through and show you some of the features of this and this is going to be the first in a series of videos on pigments so it's going to get more advanced", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4693, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name":

really cool method of of sound design then also up here you have it's set on Sample but again we have our analog and wave table so uh I didn't mention before right is that we also have um samples so if you wanted to play pianos and keys strings there are samples of this so you can actually play instruments that you know are a little bit more difficult to synthesize but you would have based on samples um and so if we wanted to turn that on we would then just turn on this second one here but we're not going to use that right now we're going to stick to our single engine um and we'll be working on the first oscillator so I'm just going to put our semitones down a little bit so I can hit in the middle of the keyboard and then we go over to our filter section here so they also have great filters and so we have the multi mode we have low pass Gates different methods here format which is very cool to make some interesting sounds this will be similar to if you guys have seen as I mentioned Serum at the beginning because there is a lot of overlap it looks and functions in a way similar so it shouldn't be too unfamiliar to you guys so we have a phaser set up and then the multi-mode is where we have in here different low pass options High Pass options and band pass so just for our purposes let's set a resonant band pass so if we put the resonance up here and we have our band pass now we can also set a second filter over here and so then again maybe we could put this one on a nice resonant uh High Pass now the filter mix is going to be here so if we want both we have to go there and we can switch between them so that's the filter section works pretty simply as you guys would expect now we're going to go into the modulation section so if we go down here you can see that we have different uh we have keyboard envelopes LFO functions random combinate and macros the macros is always up over here just like serum you can route these to multiple things and um you know so you'll have your four knobs cranking everything out we'll get to that later first thing I just want to show you is the envelopes and how everything works so right now you can see that there is an envelope already done it starts out just the basic patch routed so if I hit the keyboard it's turning off instead of droning right so that's going to be um this one here and you can see that it's routed to the end n VCA this is sorry it's called they call it the envelope VCA and it's already routed to the VCA amp um so this is how you're gonna you're gonna route things in this Center area here but we just have our basic um envelope and it's an ADR you can make it in adsr I'm sorry it's an adsr but you could make it in ADR if you want dude and then just to show you here we have our LFO section we have functions random combinate so we'll go through these on this one so we just wanted to show you we have our envelope on the amplitude already routed so we can just play Keys now let's go into the lfos to just show you how this would work if we want to Route something all we have to do is if you click in this so this one is LFO one we have then here you", "start_char_idx":

we have our envelope on the amplitude already routed so we can just play Keys now let's go into the lfos to just show you how this would work if we want to Route something all we have to do is if you click in this so this one is LFO one we have then here you can see we have different waveforms you can sync it um you can make it unipolar or bipolar it's going to be bipolar first and then if you click unipolar that'll make it unipolar and that's again whether it operates in both directions from whatever value it is or only positive or negative from there um so let's just leave it on a sine wave and let's see how we route it so if you go over here all you have to do is in the center section here click what you want so if we want to Route let's let's go to First we're going to do we'll just make the filter move like this right so if we click the lfa1 it just says Drag The Contours of the knob and so all you have to then do is here so I had it I want it in bipolar so now you can see it goes in both directions right from the middle value if we have it on unipolar it's only going to go in One Direction so and then but you could put it into the negative so if we wanted unipolar only down you would put it negative here so we're going to put it 100 up and unipolar well no not 100 let's put it somewhere around there if sixty percent fifty percent thirty percent so we get a little movement not going all the way up all the way down yet so then let's just change the rate here it's at a half so let's make it a little slower super easy routing and this is why this is one of my favorite things about it because now also you can just click any anything we hover over if we also wanted to do the position right now that's moving if we wanted to move this one in one direction or we could put it up and make it move it in the yeah what's going to do in both because we'd have a second one anyways just to show you it's moving around so this is just super easy and you can just add and it'll keep you can make a million of these and you know there's no limit to the route the modulation parameters some matrixes you know you'll run out of places here you can just keep going for a long time adding more and more so and then if you want to remove one of these things you just hit X and so now that's gone if we wanted it again we'd put it again so it's really really great way um to do complicated routings because it's just super easy and then when you click this it goes back away and then you see what's happening here which is really nice um because if we click away you're not going to be looking at that anymore so you can see different sections so now what we're going to do is just keep going through and show you the other types of um um functions here random and combinate so one thing I just with the function is this is something that is just gonna you can draw basically in some shapes and then you can apply this to something so this is really nice too it's kind of like envelope but you get to draw your own so again in serum you know you don't you have one or the other kind of I mean you cut everything's like a function that you draw um but this is super cool because you can draw in stuff if you want to do that kind of thing or you just have your typical traditional envelopes and lfos now there's also random and one of the things I love about this is the types of Random so if instead of um so basically we have three types we have touring sample and hold and binary the Turing what this means well first let's just sample and hold sample and hold is for whatever division you do it's on synth eighth notes and let's just go ahead and Route this so if this is two I'm gonna just all I'm gonna put it onto this guy so we're seeing it's moving let's get a

this is two I'm gonna just all I'm gonna put it onto this guy so we're seeing it's moving let's get a little more resonance in here so it's moving so now if we go to filter two and so then you can also you can slew it by making rise and fall or you can keep them actually you know um what an actual sample and hold with no slow I'm just dividing right at the time you can set the clock here and now this is a great thing because you can actually set the clock from other things so you could have the clock being one of the functions it could be another random LFO you could do it from the keyboard or you can put it the sequencer clock which would be the sequencer or just the normal clock which is what it sets to now but that's really cool because sometimes you want to trigger the timing of a sample and hold from something else also just a great feature so we're on sync we're on eighth notes that's for our purposes that's enough now the difference between sample and hold and Turing is Turing is basically a loop of Random so right now it's nine steps long it's also on one eighth note and you can then set this um as well but it's going to be free running here and then it's this length of so if I make longer steps it's going to run longer without repeating right and then if I go shorter it's basically just going to be one step right but so the interesting thing about this is It's like a looping random right so it creates a random thing but then it runs back and you can flip it here so this is the probability for the sequence to evolve if it's at zero the sequence will always stay the same if it's 100 random then it's more it's basically just like a sample and hold so the cool thing about this is you can kind of let it go until you get a random that you like and then you just flop that down here and then it's going to repeat and repeat that random part for whatever the length is so we have 12 steps so it's going to repeat at that so this is really cool if you want to make a random part but you don't want it to uh keep going and always be random now another type we have here is binary and so you can see that this is either going to be off or on and then you have a probability so if the probability is down it's going to say don't give me any but if you put the probability up it's always going to be up so if we go somewhere in the middle then we have you know some values going up so let's show if I want to put this to something I'm going to put it to the filter um one and two amount so now what you can see is if I click off on it we are always down on filter one and now and then when these when it goes flips to the other side it's flopping over to filter two so the filters are both moving but it's choosing which one and this one we would want either you know to have it so it's either one or the other [Music] so that's pretty cool to intersperse the uh you know some different two different types of modulation on as an example here and we'll show you know when I make future patches we'll really get into using all of these in tandem with each other right now we're just walking through what the HR so that's back to our base our three different types of um random and this is again why I love this so much compared to serum because serum doesn't really have this and serum sample and hold is in the chaos section um it doesn't have a turning you can write in a like in the function mode you can and this again has three different ones here um you can draw them in but here we actually have them that are free running and we just choose a probability and we can easily manipulate this like if we want mostly uh you know staying on filter one only popping over to filter two a little bit you know we can do that if we want more

there so it's you know you get a lot of variety and then remember the touring is like a looping random so now back to show you something else that is pretty cool is so you know um in a lot of times you would want an LFO running but you would want to make a more complicated LFO that's not just going up and down right and so what you could do is you could take another LFO like lfo2 and we could put it to say the timing here right so we could do that here so that it's moving at you know and this one is affecting this one so that's of course a way to do it which most most can do but the thing I wanted to show you here is this section called combinent and so this is another section of three where you can combine different um sources so let's say what if we wanted to take lfo1 which you already have and then we use the Second Source to say lfo2 we could also do random I mean you can just make really complicated things but just to show you so now look at this waveform that we've got going on here so now if we put this one to our cut off say instead and then we go back here if I want to just get rid of this one on the cut off we just delete it right super easy but now if we go back to uh oh uh combinent here so now the combinant one I put here and I doubled something up on lfo2 I want to turn this off so lfo1 is the wave table position here lfo2 is now not doing anything but instead we have this and as you can see this is moving now in a in a more interesting way let me just turn this down so now we've got a more complicated um a more complicated waveform going on and we can do and then there's different modes here you can sum or difference or you can multiply it so I'm gonna just get different mathematics right and divide lag threshold all these going to give you different results so this is a super cool way if you want to make a more complicated waveform out of the individual one so now since we're not using lfo2 if we were to go to lfo2 and where to say make it some different let's make it you know something like this now let's see what a combinant looks like so we're getting some drops and so this is just a super cool way to make more complicated things now for example just to show you one what if we put lfo1 with say random two our sampling now look at that really cool so uh this is just an amazing function of um of this synth that really makes it stand out in my mind so now that we've got a couple things moving around I'm going to just make this binary and it's pretty good actually so now I'm going to show you some of the other sections so we also have um you go to FX and we have our FX section up here and you can um there's multiple buses right now we just have the first well we have nothing in the second one there's a send bus as well so if you wanted to send your Reverb which is really useful um for example has that already and then the default patch just starts with the delay in the Reverb then you see here we can make it ping pong put our dry wet up um you can have high pass frequencies and our feedback yet so now we've got some ping pong pretty cool and then if we wanted to say Reverb also here dry wet so those are built in and then you see we can choose more so if we wanted also we can move the positions of these things um if we want so so by moving it here I can put the delay if I just move them and I put the reverb when I'll go here and so then in the first one say we wanted to put a distortion right so now we can choose different Distortion and put that so we have built um FX built in these", "start_char_idx":

we wanted also we can move the positions of these things um if we want so so by moving it here I can put the delay if I just move them and I put the reverb when I'll go here and so then in the first one say we wanted to put a distortion right so now we can choose different Distortion and put that so we have built um FX built in these are all great so now um what I wanted to check is um so I want to show you also is the sequencer here and so uh one of the great things about this as well is that um you know how so I'll show you really quickly if you guys see from my other videos we've watched the note length and density tutorial so I have my section here with lots of different you know just the 16th notes pattern and so let's bring this over and my grid size right so if we put this here and then we go to our midi modifiers note length there and then our density turn that on [Music] so let's go to our comment two oh because I made the LFO here [Music] comes off for a second just to show you the parts um so again we have our Rhythm coming from [Music] the fact that we're using the midi node length trick but now what I want to do is we're going to do this instead we're going to use the sequencer and we'll make everything better here as soon as I get it going so let's just see this is moving it's fine fandom II oh this is why I touched too many things got to be careful because if you're touching things then gets messed up so we have our filter to cut off is going and then lfo1 wave table position let's go ahead and make it this one slow it down a bit and now our combinant two is back looking better not going too crazy okay anyways so now we're going to use the sequencer so let's turn off this and I'm just gonna actually undo all my routing here just so that we can hear the clean um Everything clean so no routing okay [Music] good okay so now if we take away our section over there and we're just going in here turn off the midi modifiers and the midi inserts so now if I play the keyboard over here and so now let's go into the sequence so basically we have an arpeggiator or a sequencer now the difference is just going to be how they're playing the pitch the arpeggiator we could then you have a modes here so as played up down random up and down inclusive exclusive and um the sequencer is different because then you would actually put the pitch of the note here so but otherwise they're going to function the same you choose the rate here and so we have it at eighth knots if we put it to say 16th notes there we go so the thing that I love about this is if you see here we have this dice here and so we can make a random probability of our velocity trig probability gate length and slide and so if you think about our note length and density trick that's going to be the trigger probability and the gate length so let's go ahead and turn these up and you see now this higher amount here that's the amount and you can then module you can put these where you want on their own but that little lighter line that's going to be showing the value so you're going to have short notes and long notes awesome just perfect and then if we add the trig probability you can see that if we add this up it's pulling down and so some of these are going to have a lower probability playing so just a great way to make Parts come out and emerge from nowhere and then if just like with the other trick and now what we can also do is if we want we can put the sink rate here and so we could modulate that with say like one of our binary guys so we go back here I'm going to take the random three and let's put this down a little bit so that's going to give us a little bit of Randomness and now let's put the sample in hold here onto our cutoff filter foreign so we have and we remember we have our delay and stuff going but like already we have a nice lead going and let's go ahead and add in the sounds now let's put our", "start_char_idx": 18218,

and stuff going but like already we have a nice lead going and let's go ahead and add in the sounds now let's put our binary again to uh the filter amount to so sometime we get this guy [Music] and our lfos here [Music] this is what I did accidentally I gotta put the clock it's a free running or on the sequencer clock sequencer clock would be good since we're using the sequence decline and then they're resetting that's that's [Music] so let's put this one on to the second filter [Music] foreign [Music] so really cool way there to build patterns out and if you see we went to arpeggiator it'd be the same because we're have to then allow it to have different amounts um make it octave here but you can put [Music] and we can change the pitch rate we can put it up random and then you can make different sounds but I don't want any different pitches so we'll just leave that you also have randomize here on the auto regen so you can apply that but I like to then do some stuff over here by modulating like the rate amount like we did with that so you get some little variety on the rate amount while the pattern's going through so this is just a super cool synthesizer with many um options to do stuff and from here I'm going to make another video where we just go straight through and make some sounds but I just wanted to give you guys first a quick overview of everything so if we just go real back real quick from the beginning remember that we have our wave table analog um and Sample Samplers here you can choose the waveforms from here you then have um other modes that you can face Distortion phase amount also wave folding so remember we can make really complicated Sounds by you know just using a simple waveform and then modulating or changing these parameters here we have our balance between the filters we have this the wave table position 2D 3D we have our filters section here and then again we have our envelopes lfos functions the random three different types and then these combinant ones and then our macros over here which I haven't touched but macros obviously we just would route to a lot of parameters and twist one knob um and then again to Route them you just click on whichever one you want to use and then you just grab some thing like if we wanted to put the position here so now we've got the component moving on the position so super easy to use um then we remember we have our um FX section and the sequencer which is just my favorite part because you have the randomness on the gate length and the trigger probability so we can just make random lines emerge and most other things we'd have to use our note length and density trick and sometimes just real nice to work within the synthesizer so that is my quick basic overview of arturia pigments and as I said this is going to be the first in a series of videos on pigments from here on I'll just jump right in and make individual patches but I just wanted to give you guys a quick overview of how the synthesizer Works before we jump in so that people wouldn't get confused so stay tuned next video coming soon on making some killer FM style lead in arturia pigments thanks guys see you soon",

the last one and quickly make a similar sound that I was working on there we're just going to go straight through it so the first thing I have here we're in the wave table section I've created a new patch and I'm going to put this so that we get to the saw wave and so we have a saw we're going to put up some FM and then if we go down we get our tone and just wanted one thing I didn't mention here is we can on the modulator for the FM we can choose the wave type here so if we wanted to have a saw wave we can do that so this is gonna so we have a saw mixed with another saw and so then we're going to Route it to the filter and we're going to put the band pass here and put the resonance up and move this down a bit okay so now if this is moving around so first thing I'm going to use is our note length and midi um technique like we did before so let's go ahead and put it on and remember we have the length here and the density here let's see what happens great so what I wanted to show here one thing I forgot before is so if we put I'm going to put sample and hold here so if we go to random 2 which is our sample and hold the trigger is coming from the clock and so if we click random two we'll put it here this is going to move around now the tri the clock is giving the trigger right now one thing that I didn't mention before but what we can do is we could put the mono keyboard as the um Source instead of the clock so now if I hit a key it's going to do it so if we hit play [Music] now it's moving every single time there's a note so this is like the note on random in serum so if we do like that then I'm going to take the LFO and it's now let's have the clock or free running on the reset it's synced and so if we turn the timing down a little bit and then we put [Music] there we go so now we're going to put the LFO [Music] and we'll just put this onto say the we can put a little FM Mount so we get a little bit of movement on the FM [Music] foreign [Music] okay and then let's go to the FX section turn on the delay [Music] you can get a little Reverb so now I want to go instead and show you guys using the um we're going to use the sequencer instead so we're going to turn off these things and then instead of the mono keyboard Source here let's go ahead and put it on um sorry this is onto random the clock Source instead to be the actual clock and then we'll go over to the sequencer turn it on and put it to 16th notes and then we'll get some Randomness on our length and probability [Music] then we're going to use the binary here which I showed you guys before and we're going to put the binary amount going on to [Music] sometimes because [Music] [Music] and then let's go back to the synth let's turn on another filter this one will be um some resonance and we'll put a high pass put it down and we'll put lfo1 to this and then we will put our um binary also to go so if we have the random three also binary and we're going to put this here so [Music] [Applause] [Music] and if we were to put a little wave folding or something too we look at it in two day [Music] [Applause] and we have a nice basic thing going on here and sounds really nice [Music] so just wanted to show you guys that basically taking the lessons we used on the last one and just making a very simple patch that is moving around a bit got some nice movement on it and using combination of these lfos and the random now also again we've talked about the combinance so what if we try to mix these two lfos instead of moving at different speeds so if we put the two lfos here and now you see that and we could put this on our um on this instead so instead of going lfo2 oh sorry this one we can leave instead of lfo1 going to the filter 2 cut off we get rid of that and we'll go to our com one and we'll put that here so now it's moving a little bit differently and let's go back [Music] [Music] foreign guys so I just wanted to show you a quick little thing of using pigments

to show you a quick little thing of using pigments uh based on what we did last time to make one little simple thing this is kind of what I was working on and so you can see how easy it is to just route something using a few different things and make a really nice lead and you could use either the note length and density tool or the built-in sequencer to get a nice result and so this one just following off that last one and tomorrow I'm going to make another video and we'll get on showing some of the other features we'll use some of the other modes and make some different sounds and so I

"welcome everybody today I'm going to be talking about sample and hold random modulation in your Iraq I'm going to be showing off two modules the instru tag and the ssf ran step so thanks for joining please if you like the video like And subscribe and let's Jump Right In okay so the first module that I'm going to show you is this the instrument type and so this is a great sample and hold module with really cool also display that is going to be perfect for showing um how it works and the various things that we can do um with sample and hold so the first thing I'm going to do is just plug in the output of this into um this scope up here the mordax data that way we can see what's happening and then we'll start to um oh then the other thing then I will do is I'm going to turn on this we're going to use the intro neoni and I have it coming out the wave folder envelope I mean our output and so if I turn the volume up on this we just have a tone okay so now I'll just turn it down for a second while we talk so this is the time it has its own built-in clock so that you can with slow and fast modes and or you can feed it in a clock right and then this is the output and this is the noise so it's got inside it like a pink noise um thing to that drives the random so if we turn the amount up here the level and then we start going with the clock the internal rate we can see that we are getting step patterns and now if I plug the output through the scope into the one volt per octave so this way we can hear what's happening so we can get different values and then here's the slow so that's as fast as it goes on the slow mode and then you can get really super fast here okay now the other thing that we have is bipolar or unipolar so for example here with the uh in bipolar mode right now it's going to be choosing values on both sides above and below whatever the rate is the I mean the value that it's set at now and then if it goes to unipolar it'll only be one side so you and you can see corresponding the color here underneath is orange okay now the other thing that we have is slew and so you can see that this rounds off so basically what sample and hold is is what we're saying is it grabs its samples one value and it will hold that until it's told it gets another impulse like from the clock that it should find another value and so exactly like if we slow it down right you see that it's holding for a long or well yeah yeah because the clock here so it's longer right and if we even go to the slow one say see see getting it holds the value until it gets the next thing all right so super fast so that is the basics of what sample and hold is doing but with a module like this we can actually um do a lot more and get a we can okay so what we do is we can put it in LFO into this in right so I have an LFO right here this is the oct from instro and so if we go to the input here and then um the volume so if you see what happens here it's now and if I make the LFO faster right [Music] so if I make it really fast you can see that it's now following the triangle of the um get from the lso and so then an attempt right here so each time it gets a clock it will put the value it'll hold that where it is in the wave form right so slower right more Steppy but as you can see it's always following the triangle pattern right so that's pretty cool and we can then you know you get a different feel by if we go see so we're getting like chromatic steps almost [Music] right [Music] okay so now what we can also do is if we use a more complex waveform not just I mean LFO so not just a triangle if you see up here I have the bitumi and this is running in Quad road so the first these other three will control um divisions of the um of the of the it's well hey let me just show you what's happening it'll be easier than just describing it so if we go to two I'm going to turn on this blue one actually let's use the yellow one uh four okay so now if I take [Music] so if I show you here [Music] let's turn this off for a second and oh I put in two and I'm putting four okay so the yellow one here I can turn this off as well the yellow one this is our our wave form on this LFO right so I'm at the sign and you can see it's a sun right but once I start moving these right you", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4289, "text_template":

[Music] right [Music] okay so now what we can also do is if we use a more complex waveform not just I mean LFO so not just a triangle if you see up here I have the bitumi and this is running in Quad road so the first these other three will control um divisions of the um of the of the it's well hey let me just show you what's happening it'll be easier than just describing it so if we go to two I'm going to turn on this blue one actually let's use the yellow one uh four okay so now if I take [Music] so if I show you here [Music] let's turn this off for a second and oh I put in two and I'm putting four okay so the yellow one here I can turn this off as well the yellow one this is our our wave form on this LFO right so I'm at the sign and you can see it's a sun right but once I start moving these right you see then how it's changing the waveform and if we move then you can get different all kinds of different crazy waveforms like this right so as you can see we're able to get you know a little bit more Dynamic variating um LFO then just a straight triangle and that's going to be so now I'll take that and we can actually just leave that so you can see we can see both at the same time now if we put this into the input here right so now if I turn on the visibility of this and now see this is really helpful way to see you can see the now if I increase the the rate right or it's to decrease the race you see so this is very clearly showing how at each point whenever it gets it's making that value and holding it the next time so it's following the waveform and [Music] and so you get here you're seeing it kind of getting these cool patterns almost like arpeggios um come into it and so this is actually something that we can do is make some pretty cool arpeggios using this so what we're going to want to do is before we go straight in to the uh in serum should I need longer ah too long okay so if we take the our LFO oh it's actually no it's doing it right so we put that in here and then we take the output right and the output of our sample and hold we're going to use with a quantizer and it could be any quantizer but I'm going to show you the onc um which is this ornaments and crime a micro custom well just you know some small Builder made it but these are really great because has a ton of different um modes here and for trig and CV and outs for each right so there's one like quadrature which is four lfos which is cool but this one we're going to use quantumane okay and so now um wait this is going to be the or output and need a little short guy and then we take we go into the CV from the output okay so now I think you can see that yep okay so now what we do is um we can choose scale right so use refine semitone phrygian um you know lots of different scales here all kinds of stuff you can put your own in as well and so let's just choose for example like phrygian right we've got a root of G so then what we could do is tune our oscillator to one of these now so now if I I'm going to let's go into three here so that we can see we can tune and see the waveform so I'm just going to pop this guy through as well okay so now if I go to tuner mode in this and we go to three so now also I'm just going to take this out for a sec just so that here if you all right so let's tune to a g okay close enough so now we go back to oscilloscope mode okay and now if we plug in back our one volt per octave we are now in phrygian and uh I so here if we go in we also can choose which notes are active so this is every note in the scale [Music] right so this is a cool thing is that now what if we just take out some of these notes so we have like four right [Music] so now you can see we're getting these kind of cool and if we reduce the amount a bit you can also turn on this so you can see [Music] the time is it's all right we don't need to see so [Music] we're just going higher right see so getting really cool arpeggios that's kind of changing and that's just by running the LFO into the sample and hold and going through a quantizer so now I want to we want to make this a bit more complex so and make a", "start_char_idx": 3469,

just by running the LFO into the sample and hold and going through a quantizer so now I want to we want to make this a bit more complex so and make a little bit of a deeper sound and then add some more uh sample and hold and I will show you using the r d step as well now there's one other thing that I didn't cover yet um on this which is that we could run a clock in instead of just doing it um by itself and I'm going to do that now so that then we can have this ran step also be clocked the same as the intro so what I can what we do then is just run I have this MMS quad clock distributor which if I was running to connect it to the Daw um I it would have the clock coming from your midi module and then into here but um since I'm not having a clock to the computer we have a tap ability here so we can just tap a Tempo and then choose the divisions of it so I just made a tab Tempo and now we can see that this is at that Tempo so now this is not doing anything foreign and then one other thing to show you is this Holden Track which is an inverted track and hold that has a bit of a different character because as you said instead of sampling holding it holds and tracks and you can kind of see how it's different [Music] see [Music] instead of [Music] so anyways you can get some interesting results from that little microtone kind of things in there some it's fun to play with all right so now let's make this more bad ass so the first thing is um what I'm gonna do is we're in the wave fold output right so let's modulate that with sample and hold so what we're going to do is just like we're clocking this instrument from the Quad clock distributor we take the next one and we are going into the Rand step now this is a really cool module it is super Compact and packed with features so basically or functionality really it's got three okay for each thing this is the trigger so you put in like a clock or a trigger input you can put three separate ones or just this one and then they're all being triggered or clocked by that and you see that there are different divisions the left hand side of each one is unipolar and then the right one here is bipolar and the right one can also have a sample input so like an LFO that we had there we could run that into this one and then so you could have um basically six different stable and hold random outs from this tiny little 4 HP module and yeah it's just great you know it's just in so you know like we're gonna do it right now you can add quickly a bunch of modulation that's all slightly different timings but all clocked together and instead of having you know three or four different sampling whole modules you got this one for Workhorse Duty and then I'm using the intro to have a little bit more um control over certain things and this one is just a little more you know plug it in and go so let's let's try so now what we're going to do is we're going to take let's try um this bipolar one and we plug it into the CV here and then turn this up or if we're going to unipole right and so now you can see it [Music] there we go you can feel gone [Music] see that one okay and then plug this one back in [Music] okay so we're getting a little extra modulation there now what I want to do is also get some FM with the neoni so I'm going to take another output let's just take triangle is fine and we're gonna okay this is from the CSL and everything's also I'm just going to use this top oscillator and I'm going to plug it into here and now if we turn up the FM amount right all right that's pretty cool but now

into here and now if we turn up the FM amount right all right that's pretty cool but now what I want to do is I actually am going to put it into uh through zero mode and so this is going to flip which is the carrier and which is the modulator so in order to tune it we're going to then have to tune this so if I just pop this over into let's go number two for now and I go back to the tuner and go to two so now we just want to tune this guy to G okay um close enough okay and then now we plug this in to the FM and now I'm going to switch to true zero okay okay [Music] and then remove that okay and then the other thing is now you're hearing this [Music] it's not changing the pitch anymore because that would be this one right so now this is just giving us this through zero Amber which I love awesome and then [Music] okay so that's pretty cool for now so now let's keep pumping away on this guy let's take another one of its outputs um doesn't matter we can take take try this or the this one maybe and now if we go back into the vulper Octave of the neoni so this is going to be then the one that's controlling basically like the Timbre of the sound so right so now if you like I'm moving then right so we find a nice spot now the only thing is is there's no way to control the attenuation of it it's just fully in right there so this is a good opportunity to use a VCA so if I just run the this output here into VCA and then I can control the amount um let's go back to our oscilloscope so we can see everything happening all right so now I can bring in this one like that so now this is this and this are all getting sampled in the whole modulation [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay I like that [Music] okay and so now another thing that we could do is let's take another and go to even something else so what we could do is go into the wave fold of this right and then take another one of these [Music] and the same thing I'm gonna go through oh this one [Music] so one of the cool things here is that if we want to modulate this we have our attenuator already in here so what we can do is just go directly from let's say this one in to here and put the wave fold in the middle and then okay [Music] understanding of time [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so that's pretty cool and then now just to show if we were to run this through um some kind of an envelope so we can use the instruments which is up here and so what we want to do then is we need the clock as well and so if we take another one the third output of our quad clock distributor and we come over here and we put it it to this which is our adsr and then we're going to use what we can do into so you can see this there's another there's a VCA so if we take the output the CV out and that goes to our CVN and then we just run the signal through our VCA and I'm gonna just take it out here because we don't need to see the waveform like that okay so now we have an envelope right [Music] and this is what I want to do now let's randomly modulate the release time [Music] so with this one I am going to then use uh we can use say the do we want bipolar we can just try yeah we want unipolar actually so but we'll use this one into the input make sure the CV is turned off and it is linear because we're running a signal through not applying something to it and so then oh it's barely not long enough okay so now

take out the one thing that's controlling the volts per octave right which is our first one that we're doing so now we just get straight and then what I'm gonna do is take that which is where'd it go oh it's a split one here so what we're going to do now is I'm going to go through a filter right so um we can go I'm gonna do well just so you can hear it a lot I'm going to go through this the Q pass um and so this one is stereo so if we just take the output here into that and then we this is the frequency cut off and the CV input there and then I just need to these guys and it's a little hard but we can take the band pass just so you can really hear what's happening so now right [Music] and this has this is called radiation okay right so now so the filter and then now I'm just going to tune it higher so we get a nicer [Music] there you go [Music] what's up there we go what's up and now as you see we're not making an arpeggio but we're just using it to control all these pictures [Music] thank you [Music] and if I just you know we want to take actually [Music] we just have to put the all the notes back in [Music] and then also we can take it off this and just do like semitone because it's running this [Music] so it doesn't need to be pitched let me just take it out but I don't feel like doing it so [Music] all right so just uh to summarize as you can continue seeing um here if you remember from the beginning that we have used the sample and hold from the intro tie to First make a kind of arpeggiated style by running an LFO into it and then running that through a um the quantizer and affecting the pitch of the oscillator then we've also used the sample and holds various outputs from the Rand step and then also the instru as well on other parameters that are just taking CVS instead of volts per octave and so these are just modulating various things of the param of parameters of the synths we were doing the two wave folds the voltage proactive amount of the second oscillator which is changing the Timbre of the FM and then we also put it on a the cutoff of a band pass and another one on the release time of an envelope and so you can see that it's a really really great way to add some life to your patches and as I said I really enjoy this for HP ran step because it's super small there's another one that div kid um had to hand in also with the oct so you've been collaborating with the urac manufacturers but as you can see we've got four we're using four different sample and hold outputs just sending one thing in one trigger whereas you know this is three times no one yeah at least three times the size and it's just a single out but as I said you get a little bit more control because you can dial things in a bit you've got the level in here and it looks cool but uh so I really like these two in combination with each other and I hope that this was uh useful if you guys have any questions please uh add them in the comments if you like this video please like And subscribe so you can keep making more and uh yeah thanks for sticking around see you next time", "start_char_idx": 13580, "end_char_idx": 17553, "text_template":

"RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "um we don't need this it's just a ruler track okay so what I'm doing here is I'm putting my um I put some I have my channel that I'm working on I have a bunch of reference tracks right um and so I'm using my own music on this but like for you guys I would recommend to you know if you're making a track that's you know full-on or something pick a top full-on artist and use that as a reference track if you're making night music or dark tie or Forest pick a track that sounds you know like what you want it to sound like and just use that as a reference again you don't need to sound it exactly like that but it'll be a good point for checking your metering especially when you're trying to figure you know you're learning um but and then what I do is I usually I take one of my good ones and I just keep mastering all my other ones to that so that you know even if it's not perfect it's consistent um and uh yeah so then what I'll do is I'll put some meters and stuff onto the master so that way I can look and I can see the master Channel but also I get so if I'm so but I'll leave is this one unsolowed and then the other one so let's see I can switch between them and then see everything right so I can be checking out so let me just turn down a little bit more because now we're doing um but exactly so if I put the if I put all the um Scopes and stuff onto the individual Channel then you're just going to see if that one channel I want to see the same Scopes across all of the different tracks so I can just check out my reference tracks and that and then you're also listening and you just type you know do that switch back and forth and make sure they are in the right place um okay so for mastering I would say when especially when you're doing it for your guys yourself there's a bunch of you know if we were talking about how did it get you to do like to professional mastering there would be many stages there's a lot of different types of things you can use but for our purposes we're not you know in your you to really Master well you also need um your room to be treated better you need to understand how your speakers sound um you know in reference to other speakers and you know there's a lot of knowledge there and that um you know takes time to gain and so I think it's really worthwhile to you know get somebody to master your tracks personally I pay if you know with the tracks to get released everything on sangoma goes through somebody and so they eventually will pay for it but for me if the track is not going to come out for six months or who knows when it's going to come out I'll just pay for scorp to master it's not cheap but that way everything in my set is all mastered and when I'm playing out all the time I mean that's how I play out so I want it master it properly not just on the CD for other people to play but at the same time I don't want to I don't want to master the track before it's finished so a lot of times I'll finish finish a track you know get it ready to play and I want to do a quick mastering to get it so that it's close enough to my actually mastered stuff that I can play it out in my set and it sounds pretty good so that's what we're going to talk about not professional mastering but you know a home mastering uh that will allow you to get it close enough to you know play with with other properly mastered stuff so there are a few um the the mo the first thing that you're doing in you know which is the last step last stage in it but it's the most important one would be a limiter and to be honest um you could only use the limiter and actually it wouldn't go so wrong because the other thing to think about mastering your own music is you know you just wrote it so it's hard to be really objective about it you know if you send it to somebody else or even if you were listening to somebody else's music you'd be like oh there's not enough bass there's too much of this there's too much of that and fix it but if it's your own track well you're gonna think it's right because you just did it and then if you do notice something wrong well it would be better to actually since you have the project to go back and fix it rather than try to like like if you say oh that sound is you know this EQ or the percussion is not loud enough you wouldn't want to just boost the percussion it's still super loud guys sorry um you wouldn't just want to boost oh that's why it went all the way up sorry negative 15 please there we go so if you see something wrong and that the", "start_char_idx": 0,

wouldn't want to just say put an EQ and pull this down or push that up it's your music go back to the track fix it and then put it back in so I highly suggest that using your mastering process to catch the last things but then don't overdo it the mastering engineer that you send it to they'll do that kind of stuff but for our own purposes it'd be easier to fix any things you notice in your mix and then put it back through so that you could almost just do a very clean mix clean you know uh as I mean um simple mastering and even I heard um there's this some I don't know Armin Van Buren maybe or somebody like that he was talking about that when he makes when he was ready to play something out to test it before it's finished to make sure that it's good he'll just throw this one on it which is the uad Precision limiter but it really doesn't it doesn't have to be this one we can also I want to pull up um Pro l it doesn't look like that which is Fab filters and then if we want we can also talk about let's see if the if we go into um in Cubase there's gonna they have brick wall limiter and also just limiter we'll just show what a limiter would look like but so basically what a limiter is going to do any of these we can start with like the pro l you're gonna give it gain right so you're going to be pushing the audio signal up and then it's going to cut everything that goes over the threshold so you're going to be and oh this is where we want to talk about um decibels versus RMS so decibels is a measure of the peak loudness so that the uh at the loudest Peak that you have at any given moment is going to be a decibel value then you have another thing called RMS and RMS is uh the root mean Square and so this is the it's the square root of the mean Square basically what it does is it gives you a generalized and averaged mean so this is your um you know the average level uh it's it's kind of like the body of the sound if you think it's how much it's really going to how much pressure is going to be there and this is what you're really pushing up we're going to be pushing the RMS because the decibels at some point the Peaks are going to be hitting zero or above and anything above zero is going to be squashed and we are going to be pushing the RMS up underneath that and so the more you push it the more squash it's going to be and as we can just see if we do this as we go up it's reducing the sound here oh thanks babe coffee delivery um and so it's going to be cutting it and the difference in a compressor it's going to be a bit smoother this is going to literally allow nothing to go above it and there are different modes for them um where you know on some I have on the Oxford one which is really great they also make this that's not for uad the sonox Oxford limiter they have some things like a safe mode an auto comp which just deal with the way that that deals with the very top so sometimes you'll get a master track that still goes into the red and so this safe mode will deal with that this one also has a little pre-process and an enhanced curve which is very nice but the general thing is basically the same that you're going to be pushing the gain of the track up and it's going to be limiting what's there and so to be honest for most practical purposes this is what I just do to my tracks when I want to play it out because as I said if I'm applying why why put an EQ on there when I could just fix it in the track why put you know some other multi-band compressor while", "start_char_idx": 3607, "end_char_idx": 8085, "text_template":

put you know some other multi-band compressor while those things all can be good again you know I'm listening to this sound on the same speakers that I wrote it on and so it's going to be different difficult for me really to add much to it at that in that process so for my own purposes you can you know you can just put a limiter on there and the limiter will do a good job and but we'll go through also some of the other things just so you can see what what happens um so for example um types of other things you could use would be a multi-band this one is a from universal audio it's part of their mastering series but again there are many things like this there are a lot you know and also let me pull this up what's it called um oh right ozone so let's talk about ozone uh oh I didn't install it again anyways I I forgot to it's not here not sure why I have the isotope um their meter thing which is also very good um because the other thing we can talk about is luffs right luffs so here let's show what happens on let's show what happens when we just put this so we're going to use these this one sorry Windows here this is a meter and we'll go to our thing and just put push it up on the pro l ol so we have two things we have um levels here and so what you can see is you can see the top line is going to be the peak and then we are also going to have the um uh RMS right and then we have luffs and so there are three different ways and so the basically the way that the difference between RMS is RMS is going to be individually like at that moment it's hitting this RMS level the Lux is going to be a uh another um over a period of time it's going to be so here you see momentary Max loss which will show us and then the integrated lust was good it's going to be over time so you can see um and so this will just be give you it's two different two different types of ways of monitoring it and that you want to kind of think about them both usually you don't want your left to go over negative eight and same thing with your um RMS for other musics it can be different you know again here there's you don't want there's the What's called the loudness Wars where everybody's been pushing the RMS and The Lofts up um but there's a point where it's just going to sound worse if you ever listen to something like you know Progressive house they're going to be hitting it's going to be much more they're going to have higher RMS and everything but that's because it's a different music and they have less stuff going on if it were rock and roll they would have a bigger dynamic range which would mean a lower um like negative 14 decibels for the uh for the um all right RMS so anyways there's rules there's also if we look here I have this precision limiter which you can see there are different types of monitoring if I turn it on this one is cool because it it is a limiter so we can limit it here but one of the reasons I also like it is because we have different modes so there's these K modes which are basically standardized to different ranges so it'll put zero as net is actually negative 20. K12 would be 12 as the top of the bar negative 12 and k 14 would be 14 is the top so that way the top of the meter is right and so basically K20 was for like movies and stuff k14 was generally for music rock and roll K12 is for broadcast like radio and stuff like this but again that's a bit outdated but it's still a good I mean those our music we go above that so we would want like a k9 but they don't make that so um anyways but you could see if you're going above then the zero point then you would", "start_char_idx": 7153, "end_char_idx": 11642, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bb1b7b8-d3f8-4eab-960e-22694588df58": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bb1b7b8-d3f8-4eab-960e-22694588df58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/Kabayun/Development/code/personal/youtube-playlist-chatbot/server/data/Home Mastering your own tracks.txt", "file_name": "Home Mastering your own tracks.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 28963, "creation_date": "2024-05-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff508f7f-e5e6-4822-873b-510fce22ca6d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/Kabayun/Development/code/personal/youtube-playlist-chatbot/server/data/Home Mastering your own tracks.txt", "file_name": "Home Mastering your own tracks.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 28963, "creation_date": "2024-05-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-18"}, "hash": "c47b81bc6201041f1e5b8802ba10539e48e3a7d4cf478f37c1b50ba6eb65762c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ade40580-a277-4c64-9438-38ad6de29a0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/Kabayun/Development/code/personal/youtube-playlist-chatbot/server/data/Home Mastering your own tracks.txt", "file_name": "Home Mastering your own tracks.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 28963, "creation_date": "2024-05-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-18"}, "hash": "ea159959adceefc79f6a04cc0b9258821e9c1297dda7772ce4e73cd8999bada8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c45f96a-30b6-43ab-b7b4-ab4cf2b6a5ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf5c3ea1609eb3c503987354dd2f77a964c0b76453bb09486a35e562ad4f0761", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "this precision limiter which you can see there are different types of monitoring if I turn it on this one is cool because it it is a limiter so we can limit it here but one of the reasons I also like it is because we have different modes so there's these K modes which are basically standardized to different ranges so it'll put zero as net is actually negative 20.

music rock and roll K12 is for broadcast like radio and stuff like this but again that's a bit outdated but it's still a good I mean those our music we go above that so we would want like a k9 but they don't make that so um anyways but you could see if you're going above then the zero point then you would know so we could also see it in just Peak and RMS and in here we have a zoom option so you can see it so if I hit play again this is our Peaks and this is the RMS so so this is a good limiter but at the same time you guys don't need that like you talked constant loudmasters yes exactly so this is the thing it's also you know if you ever listen to T if you're watching TV and you're watching a movie or something and then a commercial comes on you're like what the it's so loud that's because they have compressed the they're limited the  out of that advertisement so that it's like really loud and um yeah in the in there's been is this trend that everybody was trying to make their mastering louder so but again it's apparent loudness there's a difference between actual volume loudness and apparent loudness so something seems louder but it's not actually louder there's a maximum range also loudness is determined by your speakers you know if you turn your speakers down it's quieter right so it's not actually a measure of how loud it is it's a measure of how loud it seems right and so if you just push stuff up together it's going to seem louder but also it's gonna You're Gonna Lose a dynamic range and for our music dynamic range is very important also the constant loudness is important so you have to get a balance of that um so let's just look here at the we're not going to use the Precision one because I want to show you guys stuff so this is isotope Insight um and then just the pro out so here we're getting our um so we have yep you can see here this is the range and then this is the top there so average and if we push it up now we've got it that the that you see the top is hitting is at zero or above right because this is we need to turn on they need a safe mode or something here but it's getting all the way to the top and then this is going to be showing us our RMS levels down here this as you can see we have the momentary Lofts and then the integrated left and so the integrated left is a great way to do it because it's going to take your sound and over a few seconds and as everything's adding up and give you a nice balanced one so this is the one that you don't really want to go above eight negative eight um but again an eight negative nine somewhere in this range is where you want to be all right so that's already getting us into the levels we want now what I would do is just to show you to with to level it out what we're going to do is just I want to a b it against some other um tracks that I already have mastered so let's listen oh and actually sorry I was saying with the RMS you don't really want to go above negative with with the integrated left so you could go up as high as like negative seven and a half negative seven it depends also again some tracks if they have more mid-range and stuff you'll see the balance of RMS to Lost is different than something that is more open and so these are not rules as much as guidelines okay [Music] so those are kind of a different example because as you can hear the bass in this phase change one is um sounds totally different and this one's sitting a lot lower so a little bit of a hard comparison and maybe we can try a different one [Music] foreign sound different but our levels are staying the same basically between them and so that is giving us that means that we're in close range and their levels are about right where we want them to be if we did it like this and we hear this and we're down here and also if you just click this it resets so obviously this can be too quiet so we're still getting it louder when we do it to the other one so I would say I need a little",

different than something that is more open and so these are not rules as much as guidelines okay [Music] so those are kind of a different example because as you can hear the bass in this phase change one is um sounds totally different and this one's sitting a lot lower so a little bit of a hard comparison and maybe we can try a different one [Music] foreign sound different but our levels are staying the same basically between them and so that is giving us that means that we're in close range and their levels are about right where we want them to be if we did it like this and we hear this and we're down here and also if you just click this it resets so obviously this can be too quiet so we're still getting it louder when we do it to the other one so I would say I need a little more so somewhere around there would be good and again one other thing I'll mention is that in my masters when I usually can't uh thanks guys yeah more coming soon uh but when I do my own mastering also I can't quite get it as loud and uh as loud as say scorp does without compressing it a bit too much so usually I'll just leave it a little bit lower you know I won't squash it if mine sounds and like The Lofts are a little bit lower that's fine because then on the mixer I'll just be aware and I might gain it up I just find that if I push too hard and I try to exactly match um the mastering then you might squash it too much and it would be a little better to have a little more dynamic range and then gain it up if you need to while you're playing your set then to over squash it and again the professional matching Engineers are going to have better equipment and everything so they'll be able to get a cleaner result with more pumping um but right so you don't necessarily need you know don't try to exactly match whatever your track is get close to it and a little under it just because you know you're never going to be able to do as good as the professional Master did on your own system so now I just want to show you a couple of the other types of things I would use um if I was doing some mastering for somebody else or if I wanted if I decided I wanted to tweak things a bit more and have some more control so there's a few different things you can use um as I said this Precision multiband this one I really like this is pretty cool because uh and there are others that do this this is I got a uad Precision mastering series when I first got my uad and it came with a couple basic ones the great thing about this is it is multi-band but it has the option to be a compressor expander and gate so you can choose different modes so you can either expand or compress and so this is nice because sometimes you might want to expand a bit say the high frequencies but compress something else so if I hit this one you can see that it has three types of modes here and so I can put this one if I wanted to compress it and let me turn it on so now you can see we're compressing the low frequencies a little bit and you don't really want this you don't really want to compress when the kick is hitting but this could be useful if there's something that's stepping onto the kick a little bit you know so um and then you can see it's going down for compression and this one is expanding so here I have it on the expander and if we listen to the high frequencies you can also mute enable and everything or solo so we can just hear different parts of it and tools like this can be really useful to hear and to just change things and so sometimes when I'm doing a little masking for somebody else if the percussion is too low you can expand it a little bit if you have some mid-range stuff that's hitting too much you can compress it the other thing to do is if say you wanted to you know boost part of the track and not you know like the high frequencies you wouldn't want to put a parametric EQ on the entire mix because it's just going to affect the frequencies next to what you're doing so what you can this is a good way also if you just say I need a little bit more mids you could just bring it up with a multi-band because the way that these crossovers are going to work is just make it a little bit cleaner and so you won't affect the frequencies down here when you're boosting it here so as you can see we can boost the frequencies if we wanted here and it's just going to be a little bit more subtle and a little bit more smooth so multi-band compression and stuff like this can be a useful tool then just to", "start_char_idx": 14360, "end_char_idx": 19032, "text_template":

like this can be a useful tool then just to show you some things that people use that that are going to give you a better result is this is an EQ that I would use this special mastering EQ they also make a normal non-mastering version but this is called the manly massive passive it's based on a hardware thing that is you know renowned for mastering and so this one basically it's you can either make it stereo so each side is if I move this it's moving on both sides basically you just have a couple points that you choose to bandwidth here the frequency how if again oh sorry this is the frequency the bottom and so you choose the place where it is um you have low pass and high pass here mastering ones if you want so if you needed a low pass or high pass these would be very good ways to do it and then you have individual ones in this you can see they're different their shelves or uh if you if it's a shelf right then it would look like that and just different um this is the the bandwidth or the queue the frequency sorry the resonance uh so again at the bottom you would want to be using sharper ones up here you'd want to use smaller wider ones but this can be a good way if you wanted to boost or cut sometimes if we need a little more hi-hat and you could be boosting so you can hear more air more percussion up there but this kind of tool can be very good if you want to tweak your stuff a little bit um and it's something that I would use when I'm doing mastering for other people the next thing that I would use is uh so to talk about something else is that in so again for our own purposes if I'm just Mass the track to play out on the weekend I might just do the limit arm you know because again I wrote the track what am I going to do but um just to see what people are really doing there's another important thing to mastering which is called gain staging and so this can help you to basically instead of putting the limiter not that one instead of putting the limiter and having it go up 12 decibels or something like that you would get the each stage of the way you would be slowly boosting the volume so here in this I could put that in and I could put the gain up a little bit to give a one one decibel coming out of this um then I could use what this is called the Shadow Hills mastering compressor it's a dual compressor so it's I'm going to use it in Stereo mode but you could have it in mono cool thing about this one is it has two different types of circuits one is an optical and one is a discrete and this is just you know this is just algorithms in the computer but in the actual box um the this is modeled on there are different types of circuits and discrete using discrete Electronics Optical is using an optical circuit so uh they both have slightly different results so what we can do here though that this is really useful because it'll apply subtle compression before we go to the um to the limiter so that can give us a little bit of shaping the sound and help also as we do it gain stage our way up so I have the threshold here and then the gain so if we turn this on I'm getting a little bit of here and then what I can do is I can give it some gain which will then go into the next one and then we could gain it up here if we need to [Applause] much and one thing here when you're doing in mastering compression you want long attack times you see here the attack time is on 30 because basically you don't want to be squashing any of the Peaks and stuff you want to be subtly pushing it up right so you want long attack time on this which is what we can choose here on the discrete also the lower the ratio is the less the more transparent it's going to be so if you just want it to be very very subtle and use it as a boost you could", "start_char_idx": 18111, "end_char_idx": 22764, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"},

higher two three wouldn't want to go all the way you want to keep it usually on the lower end but the most important thing is that the attack is going to be long on any mastering compression but again as you can see now if we do this and we look at our levels here when we put this on we're gaining some volume already so now when we go to our Fab filter we don't need to go up to Pro to 10 anymore we could probably do something around eight I don't really need to apply you don't need to um put the gain on the limiter up very much some people would even do it so by the time it's gotten to the limiter it's all the way up there and it's just catching the Peaks and stuff but this is a good tool because then you're going to shape it as it goes up and each step of the way so it's going to be more transparent if you don't have giant boosts like this um so that's just something to know again it's less important when we're doing our own home mastering but just to know the way that the people who are professionally mastering it they're going to be doing that stepping the gain up with each step of the way anyways um and then let me just show you so you can see um that um what this this limiter does well here we can uh if I there's one other tool here this is called a maximizer and it looks just like the other one but what this is going to do is it's basically a it's got a shape here and a mix and it's going to be shaping the sound and adding if you look at it it adds little ridges almost to the uh to the waveform right and so this is basically in um in the analog world you know when you say something's warmer this is kind of what it's doing um and this obviously is not analog and you don't want to do a lot of this because it will really change the sound but very subtly this can put you know make it sound a little bit brighter a little bit more full um and the one reason I really love this Oxford EQ or limiter from uh um uad but also they you know this is you can get this one by it not through the Oxford plugins are available in a bunch of different ones but it has this enhanced curve so first if we just listen to the master again so we're seeing the level here and the amount of gain reduction here [Applause] now we're going to listen what happens when I push this enhanced curve up so this is going to be doing a very similar thing to the max maximizer which is just enhancing The Sound by overlaying it with um something that's going to then just make it a little and you'll just hear if you listen carefully while we do this so as you can see it says here if we hover over it Dynamic enhancement and uh it's you know affecting each individual sample so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's down now the key to here is as you can see it's not changing the Lofts very much because you're not actually pushing it anymore you're not increasing the range but you can hear that it sounds Fuller right how it sounds uh more dynamic or more not Dynamic but more it sounds Fuller it sounds like you squashed a more brighter exactly everything and so this is a really useful tool and so some of these if they have the enhanced built in then it's great and I would not use a maximizer if they don't have it we can try it with the maximizer here which was this one you would put it um and so this one right anyways if we just listen to the shape and then I'll move the mix up [Applause] all right [Music] so that's down and you can see", "start_char_idx": 21895, "end_char_idx": 26308, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

see it sounds Fuller and brighter and again but again you don't want to do this all the way on the maximizer I use it there's you know the preset there says is it on because it's just really subtle because if you do this too much especially if it's after the limiter then you know you're going to be pushing you're going to be changing it and then you also might get Peaks above it but this is a useful tool so that you can make it sound more full sound brighter without over squashing it because you don't want to over squash your music um and then because then what's going to happen is people think that you you can push it up and it'll just be louder and louder but there's a point where you won't be any louder you're actually that's going to be hitting the compressor and it's going to duck the sound more and so it'll sound like it was depressed you know you hear these little bounds and that just means the music was over over limited over compressed and so you just want to watch out for that and that's why these enhanced things are really great um but again you know even the big boys the pros a lot of times we'll just put the limiter on and Pro is great I mean any basically any clean limiter you have is it's going to be great um and you know just put it on take a reference track and get it to you know approximately the right level and you know test it out because again as I said if you're mastering your own music it's hard to make the appropriate changes because you wrote it uh let's see here okay so that is the basics of mastering again the purpose of this is for you know you want to you make something and you want to compare it to something else you want to play it out you want to play it but I still recommend you know eventually when you're ready you know send a track to a professional masking engineer and pay them to do it and then you can compare that to your own and then also if you get one mastered then you can use that track as your reference track when you're doing your own mastering rather than somebody else's music because of course it's always going to be closer but for the now for the moment you guys I would you know and also if you look at the waveform with the analyzers or not I mean look at the waveform but also look at the Spectrum the the frequency analyzer you know you can compare to your favorite music you know so if you really see that you know your favorite music is how somebody you know your favorite artist has uh their percussion is much higher than yours well then you'll be able to see that clearly and you can make those corrections but again I'd go back into the project and fix it that way", "start_char_idx": 25428, "end_char_idx": 28962, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

I've been using it a lot more in the past couple in the past year or so but mostly for sounds like sound design effects leads things like that I haven't been using it in the base because I was never quite happy with the envelopes and the cut and the filter and just getting the you know kind of Snappy sound that I wanted and then I saw this video by uh Dash glitch how to make perfect side trans base with with vital and uh came out like two weeks ago I think and so I'll put a link to that down here and um there's a couple tricks in here that uh I have employed and myself and are working very well to get the sound so I wanted to show you my take on what he's done and expand on it a bit uh with some other things in the chain after vital um to make it even better so that's what we're going to do today and let's Jump On In okay so the first thing is um I've got vital here I'm working in Cubase and I've got a vital open and so let me just quickly show you uh what dashes sounds like and then what mine sounds like just and then I'll walk you right through it all right so let's check in and let's check out what the mix of these two channels sunset okay so that is um that is the base from um from from glitch from Dash glitch and here's mine and it'll be a little different because I'm a different key a little bit faster it's just for a track I was working on recently um or for superluminal track but anyways you can hear what it sounds like okay quite similar and I'll just walk you guys through what is happening and what we're doing here um Okay so the first thing to show is that we are using one oscillator we've turned it into an upward ramp by just drawing it in here and then with the phase and down these all down to zero we've got the envelope which is controlling the um you know which is a defaults to controlling the um amplitude and so we've just got the release Here set under where it will click and but but it's we're not using the Decay or anything really here just to sustain completely open so now this is the thing that um Dash's video did such a good job of explaining which is that these lfos can be used in envelope mode which you can then um you know sync to the frequency I mean the um you could go to the tempo right um and so we have these at 1 16 and so for example this is now being run to the cutoff filter here the I mean the level of the first filter not the cutoff sorry and so we can really draw in our shape um to sound exactly the way that we want and and before uh the next note will start but then the real trick thing here is using these two Envelope lfos as envelopes to both control the filter and this is the thing that I didn't really like about it was the filter just using one on using an envelope like I normally do with the Decay just didn't get it so this is a very cool trick even one didn't quite do it but you can mix two together so it's great and everybody if you want more on this please go watch Dash's video it gives a big um um I have the link below in um in the description and he does a great job of it so I'm not going to go too in depth on that I'm just going to then move on from this and so then the next thing that we want to show is is that he described how you could have um you can remove the fundamentals right and so so instead of using a side chain you have one um that is so he basically did this on one channel in uh bit wig and again Watch the video and you'll see what I'm talking about I use Cubase we have to do it a little bit differently but it's not that much different basically what I've done is just duplicated my channel and this one saying have no fundamental right and so then I have the second the third and fourth sixteenth notes of the bar of the beat um as the full one and then just the first of the three 16 note bass notes is on the one with the no fundamental so now if I open up um just these uh Pro q3s and you can see this one is the full one with the fundamental and this one doesn't have and so you can exactly see what's happening here and the rest of it all stays the same and so this allows us to um you know deal with the overlap between the kick and the bass because we hear I have a 16 I mean an eighth note kick that's sloping down a little bit but we need uh with a fade out but we still need to deal with that overlap and so by removing the First", "start_char_idx":

negative 7.5 um so this is my Dash left at the end of his video and it sounds good but most of a lot of what really um takes a baseline into that really professional quality that's going to just blast all the big dance floors is not just is is yes having a very clean simple stuff inside the synth so like our Vital again you know we're not adding up there's no effects no Distortion things like that in here you know no compression it's just saw and then in envelopes on the filter and the um and the and the volume and that that's it right and that's what we want to keep it real nice and clean and then also we don't need to a lot of times um use things like have a high pass filter which can cause some issues because you've just got a really clean starting point but still there's more that needs to be done so from here I want to build on what Dash has done in his video and show you guys what I do after this right so the first thing we're just I'm going to show you on um we'll be changing on the main um one and then I'll add into the fundamental afterwards right so I'm going to close this close these guys down so we've got our ocular scope here I've got it on the kick and based bus channel so you can see together how it's going to change and so already right we do see and you see it's very um it's it's a perfect saw right it's super clean but what we can do and what I really like to do is Okay so these there's of course many different ways to bake a cake and to make a baseline And so these are not necessarily the ways but um these are tried and two techniques that I've used and um you know other people I know do similar um variations on this right and so the first thing that's going to be very important right to really tweaking our base is going to be using some sort of multi-band distortion right so right now I have I'm using this is in um Cubase so I have quadrophones V2 I know some people love the old version but you know it's this one is great too I've also got a Fab filter Saturn here for a different kind of effect this one's on clean tube these are on tape and we'll see what's how it changes this right so the first thing let's just go ahead and play it and now I'm gonna um to make off the bypass so you see what has happened here right look at the form the waveform it goes from this very clean saw to now having some a little funkiness going on and it sounds it sounds in a way that I really like and I think really works well gonna get an extra bit of meat and a lot of grit to it a little bit more power and one of the key things that you want to do here though is if you so what's important about this is I'm not even putting the drives up here on any of them right and they're all just at zero the key thing about this is not even really adding the Distortion it's the multiband by breaking the bass into different bands like this it changes the shape of the waveform and if you if I move this bar here to change this so let's do it right now look at what's happening I'm pointing at the screen you can't see but look at what's happening in those last two notes there because these are the only ones I'm changing at the moment right so you see how it's changing a lot so we can get the cut we can really tune the type of sound that what we want so I'm gonna go back to where I had it at uh 61. where it's right in between the fundamental and the first harmonic so everything from the first harmonic up is in this middle one okay um and so you and then these higher ones you know you can put you you", "start_char_idx": 4145,

the first harmonic up is in this middle one okay um and so you and then these higher ones you know you can put you you know I I usually will use a note frequency chart and find the um so I know which key I'm in and you know get them uh roughly between the various the different harmonics um and of course it's more important down here where there's a big there's a lot more space between um frequencies up here as everything becomes condensed then you know it and it's also this the basis most of the content is down here so it's really these two that we want this one a bit but you know you can just season these to taste right um but this is the key one here that you really want to dial in where you put in the placement of it so um now let me just show you if I do if I mute this one and I show you with a Fab filter Saturn instead let me just put this back to zero here um okay so now we're going to use Fab filter and let's see what happens here so again you see it goes from the straight ramp to squiggly guy and this sounds different here because again I have the cutoffs in different places and again let me just show you what happens if you move them you know you see how it's changing so you can really dial this in foreign and then here a lot of times I'll put a little bit of drive a little bit on this one but not on that one don't have to though and again it's not actually the drive that changes it it's the bands right so you see how this isn't really doing that much it's a little fatter right but the completely changing the whole waveform is this so um and then sometimes I'll use both so now let's try using two okay now we're getting a little bit in here because a lot of times what I like to do is have one and not have two that have four bands so maybe get rid of say this band and so we just have two I mean three sorry and can that way you know you have a little bit more variety between just and you change it and so I'd have to dial this in a bit more but you see we can get a completely different feel right and uh you know we can play with moving this around we could put it somewhere like this let me just check on the speakers real quick yeah see that sounds pretty nice right there so again um you can do a lot with to change the the character of the bass with multi-band Distortion and so this ultimately you can take a base from any synth anything any soft synth whatever it is as long as you can get nice tight envelope so you can really get that clean shape that you want and then you throw on some multi-band distortions and um you know move the cutoff points between them to dial in the character that you want so now I'm just going to keep going with just the um the quadrifuz for a minute so we'll leave that and now I want to show you um two other things that I like to do on the base because so let me open up the pro Q3 so you can see again what's happening with the waveform so if we look at the waveform of the base up here we've got this it's just kind of going straight down on a straight angle here right if I hold in here you'll see right okay so it's just cruising straight on down there and what can really help sometimes is to cut out not cut but just scoop a little bit out of some of these harmonics right and so there's two places that I find are important so one of them we can do right here on the pro queue just use a normal parametric to get rid of that second harmonic so it'll be the third bump that you see that's the fundamental first harmonic second harmonic right so we're just carving this out a little bit and now if I if we mute this off you can hear subtle but it definitely makes a difference right and now the other thing that I like to do is to scoop out a little bit more of the mid-range low mid-range up here in the 400 to 500 400 something around there and here so let's just look at it it's this area these guys right so this is what's starting to scoop out now because I turn it on this area up here right I want to dip here a little bit now I could just do it with a um parametrical Cube but the problem is is that as we get into here you know there are as the harmonics get closer together it's easier parametrics can they whatever uh frequency you're cutting you're also influencing the frequencies next to it so what I found is um something that works um a bit better for me is to use um this something like this is an analog modeling EQ from the", "start_char_idx": 8355, "end_char_idx": 12870, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

hear subtle but it definitely makes a difference right and now the other thing that I like to do is to scoop out a little bit more of the mid-range low mid-range up here in the 400 to 500 400 something around there and here so let's just look at it it's this area these guys right so this is what's starting to scoop out now because I turn it on this area up here right I want to dip here a little bit now I could just do it with a um parametrical Cube but the problem is is that as we get into here you know there are as the harmonics get closer together it's easier parametrics can they whatever uh frequency you're cutting you're also influencing the frequencies next to it so what I found is um something that works um a bit better for me is to use um this something like this is an analog modeling EQ from the still it's called Stillwell 1973. and so this um if we turn it on it I just have on this middle band here I put it the lowest one at 360. and now you can if we just go you'll see now if I put this up let me undo it look it's this frequencies that I'm talking about you hear that ringy like a little frog so we don't want that so I just pull it out a little bit right so you get a little dip here and then you also are getting a little bit of a dip on the second harmonic and I find that this makes a much cleaner sound all right um and so the only other thing that I sometimes like to use and also notice we don't even have a roll off here you know we don't have a high pass here um which is nice because a high pass then we would need to use zero uh um you know it we would either have a resonant Peak where we're doing it in Paramount in zero latency or we do linear phase but then there's pre-ringing issues so if we don't have to use it better and another way that you can deal with the if you have too much bass right without using a parametric is you can adjust the gain of different bands right so we can and you can see what's changing here so we can do a little bit there by doing it like that and same thing I do this sometimes a lot of times when I'm using the um Saturn I'll do that because I find that the Saturn also you can dial in the tone on each like a EQ curve on each one so a lot of times I'll put this band down a bit because it gets pretty juicy and so this is just a good way to also you see you can just bring down that bottom there so this is another thing you can do to adjust the various levels the levels of the bass um without having to use a high pass so let's go back here and then one other thing I'll show you that I sometimes use is little Labs voice of God and there's one I think called um somebody told me there's a freeware version of this that doesn't have to be uad but this is something like people use rbase or Max bass and stuff which is basically um you know this will make a resident Peak um but it just Blends it in in a way that is a lot smoother and um I just feel it doesn't muddy up the the sound unless you put it on a low frequency and smash the amplitude up then it's definitely going to be muddy but if you dial it in right you can find the frequency that you want to boost you can give it a little touch and it could just add a little bit more meat but again this is one of those things is less is more subtle you see I have the amplitude on one here right so I'm not doing that much because again you can overdo it pretty easily so now let me just turn on the um because I wanted to you also see that this spike is still happening here it's now what happens when I turn on the quads boom so when I dialed in that point let's look here again I have it 61.", "start_char_idx": 11971, "end_char_idx": 15682, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

okay so six one anyways but you see how that is also fixing our spiky guy so we don't have this summing causing a big a big spike right so that's another thing that you can use the um the multiple distortions for is to deal with some of the ways that they overlaps right so now if I just turn on the other things here and I think my Pro Q3 I also want to just put this guy back on okay so this is um yeah now let's see you've got everything on here yep so okay so now it's here this is the way this sounds with all of the with the multiband distortions on right and now if I turn them off right so still good right but super super clean and then now once we add our stuff in boom we get this just pump and feel you know and also you know something that's great about having such a clean nice starting point and doing all of this stuff after not doing it inside the synth is that then we have this nice clean thing that we can make a ton of different styles of Baseline do using um you know we could potentially change just a little bit of the um envelope in vital you know we could make it a little tighter if we want if we wanted this you know we could bring it down so we could change these things a little bit to get a little bit different characteristic and then we can use different combinations um different types I mean if I change this from tape to tube uh wait I if I change this from type to tube you get a different sound you know and um so you can really experiment and as I said here let's put it back on the second one so now we have two right I would dial in the two a little bit more um if I was gonna do it and I'm really kind of liking Justice quadrifuz right now um but right so you can really make a wide wide variety of bass lines um just by you know doing these processes afterwards and um you can turn a nice clean straight you know um tight Baseline coming straight out of your soft sand whether it's vital like in this one or serum or whatever you want to use and then apply these processes afterwards I usually just have a base a chain of these plugins that I leave here and so if I want I can just throw them all on and then just you know tune them adjust them to taste but that way I don't have to click every single time I just say this is my base chain and then I adjust each time as needed so that is basically all I wanted to show you today in props and shout out to dash for making that video and helping me to get over my uh uh get over the reasons I wasn't using vital to make base and uh you know and then um make something I think that's pretty killer definitely going to be using this and they're probably going to be making some we're making a preset pack and I'm definitely going to use this um vital now to make a bunch of Base presets so those will come out later and so I just want to say thanks everybody please like And subscribe if you like this video and um also check out a patreon that's something that helps me to be able to make these videos so thank you very much and we will see you next time", "start_char_idx": 15683, "end_char_idx": 18817, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

see if you like it uh here the first thing that I have is I'm running this is the dpvco saw uh sorry Square saw triangle sign just going to these four things here right these are like the pan controls for the four corners and then this is the mix um and then the mix is just going into a VCA and then I'm just playing um like a line and it's got up here you see this is the uh um Peaks it's just you'll hear [Music] Square uh [Music] triangle [Music] [Music] then um it's just filter I have it on I was supposed to be a low pass but anyway this is just mixing between before if I take just a straight output and go here [Music] so this can be nice if you want to mix different uh waveforms together and you know make a pattern that is Shifting between them all [Music] so that is first way now pause for one second we're going to go to the other way that it I really like to use this so I'm unplugging everything here we can keep the saw I mean the sine wave which we just want one of them and instead of going through the planar here we're going to just use it so did that this brings us back [Music] so here let's turn that down for one second so this time I don't actually want a um to go through I don't want to make a sequence we just want to straight up sound [Music] and so then we're going to use two on the CV here one of them will go down to the V the voltage per octave on this one I'm just going to Route this through uh over here a spectrum analyzer scope I can't see it but it's there and then back uh not long enough back to the filter okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] like a band pass right [Music] and I'm imagine putting a delay or something and then we can mix in different things [Music] [Applause] ah [Applause] and also let's go instead of sign s [Applause] that's the filter [Applause] [Music] and you know run that through to receiver or delay or something for example [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and then if you take the other one [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but oh man I love playing like this stuff like this all the time and so you know just the two outs of the CV and you know you can really like plus an LFO or something and you can really like you know do a lot to um to control your patch in a way that you can't get really with Hands-On you know and there are other also things there's a gate here so you can press the button and there's also a cvy and X that are um uh you can like pass through uh CV signal and then have the amount of it come through as it's going in and then out which is also another way um and then you can also run out individually so it's it's really you know you can do a lot but the two ways that I end up using it the most are as I said using you also can use it as an actual pan you know I mean if you want I have an a pan device down here um and so you could use this to control the pan amount I mean left to right it's not that special or anything but anyways um you know you have that if you had a you I mean you have four directions but yeah so those are the two ways I use it four way through and then like this controlling some Pitch thing with an LFO and also a band pass filter and running it through into a delay stereo delay and Reverb on the computer and yeah awesome so anyways hope this helped you and uh I mean there's also the new version of the Plano this is planar one but when the new version came out you can pick this one up for really cheap and you know totally worth it I also have this uh joystick but the thing is is it doesn't stay in its place so it always resets to the middle and um yeah so when you want to grab it it's you're always going to be you know pushing it around it doesn't stay in its spot it has a button can be fun but it's nowhere near as good as this one which right stays into the spot that you're putting it on",

there so what we're going to do is we're going to turn on b and we're going to do fm and we're going to want to [Music] put this down and let's go we're going to do basic shapes so we're going to choose just a sign or saw here and then over here we're going to choose one of these spectral ones [Music] kind of like where that's going so anyways the point here is not as much specific sound but how we're gonna use it so okay we've got our basic little fm sound let's go ahead and we can see what happened to the waveform as i showed you before now let's go ahead and add a little so and we have to apply this to b and we can get rid of level because we just want one okay and probably we can put this to a band pass and you see the octave that we play has a big effect over what the sound sounds like so now we're going to i'm going to show you the trick in cubase so that we can generate a pattern with this so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to create a blank midi part i'm just going to make it shorter one bar just for ease of drawing everything let's go ahead and zoom in here so we're over here find our octave probably this one and i'm going to make 16th notes and then i'm going to make them a little bit shorter so that they don't overlap so let's go make them just about that long so we're getting them the part just going around and there's a little bit there because these ones aren't synced so you can see that the sound is changing a little bit between them um which is fine and so now what we're going to do is to get set up our the the rest of the note midi trick so if we go in here we have basically what i've done is just make these 16th notes and if we go here in um the midi modifiers section over on the inspector what we can do is we have a bunch of controls here um to control the mini so the first is obviously transpose which can be useful if you put your notes in the wrong place or just trying different octaves so we can change it there you can also shift the velocity if you want it to be louder or i mean higher velocity lower um these ones don't really need to use these are going to set the divisions um what we want is these guys these little random ones so you can randomize the position the pitch the length and the velocity if we were to randomize the pitch this is what we did in the percussion one because we were using different samples so this will randomly select different notes so if we do this it's going to pick different notes and if we go so that's going to get lots of different random values it's not going to be in a key though so if you wanted to do this kind you can go into the midi inserts and there is midi modifiers here as well and if you do it in this place you can then choose a scale so i think we're in f sharp we could choose something arabian and then now if you do the pitch and randomize it it will only play notes that are in the arabian f-sharp still not exactly what we're looking for but this can be you know if you want some bleepy kind of sounds and you want random notes but you want them to be in a key you can use this what we really want here is the length control so what we're going to do is by putting if we put this down and the maximum up this is basically saying that for every note that it's going to play here pick the the length so it's going to modulate it by to make it smaller or longer now these numbers don't correspond to actual times um let's see sorry uh tillin says yes so the mini modifiers in ableton um i can show like we can open up ableton in um in this lesson and i will show you how to do that uh it's a little bit you kind of have to use a little bit of a trick there's a max for live um density plug-in it doesn't come in normally so that's the next thing i'll show you but you can do this in ableton by creating this same pattern and then you put on the note length midi device which is built into ableton and then if you modulate the note the gate time on that then you will and if you were to use a stepped random lfo to choose the different note lengths that would be essentially doing the same thing and so if we hear it now so this is what we want some shorter notes some long notes now you'll notice if it plays a longer one and it goes into the next it will skip the next um but what we can do here", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4406, "text_template":

open up ableton in um in this lesson and i will show you how to do that uh it's a little bit you kind of have to use a little bit of a trick there's a max for live um density plug-in it doesn't come in normally so that's the next thing i'll show you but you can do this in ableton by creating this same pattern and then you put on the note length midi device which is built into ableton and then if you modulate the note the gate time on that then you will and if you were to use a stepped random lfo to choose the different note lengths that would be essentially doing the same thing and so if we hear it now so this is what we want some shorter notes some long notes now you'll notice if it plays a longer one and it goes into the next it will skip the next um but what we can do here to make a little bit more space is by going into into the midi modifiers and we choose density and this is what you'll need to get uh there's a couple macs for live ones i think it's called density i can give them to you i have it it's just a little tiny file so if we put down this to 50 right it's going to say for each note there will be a 50 chance that it will play and so we'll get approximately half of the notes coming through if we put it even lower we'll have less coming through so when we use this in the the other day in the percussion we were using the density to just pick a few random ones and then we were using the pitch because it was a sampler to choose different notes which would be a different sample here we're going to modulate the note length and then put the density down so that we have a bit of empty space so nice already we get a little pattern to them and now if we just unmute this and make our loop bigger so then i'm going to hit four which is glue in cubase and i'm going to glue those four so that they're bigger and we'll go this long and loop it oh another thing i want to do is since i'm done with these parts for now i'm going to this way i can keep everything organized i'm just going to drop these into my leads in fx folder so i drop those in leads and fx is muted so we don't hear them now and we're back to nice clean look also can pull that down so so we're getting a pattern all ready to emerge um yeah no chance from max for live yeah that can be uh cool i haven't played with that one but the cool one thing that's great about ableton compared to cubase is that there's this you know unbelievable resource of of of max for live devices so basically anything you think you can imagine um it can do um so yeah ableton's very cool for that but you kind of have to sometimes search a bit and try there's also another um there's aja's funk arp which is cool and that has it's a little max for live device that will play um different note lengths and different patterns there's also um mono sequencer now this one's really has a lot of complexity to it and is very very good but it can do exactly the same thing too so yeah there's a bunch of great um plugins for max for live that will do the same thing but this is something that's built into cubase which is just you know one of super useful and so one of the reasons i'll do this is imagine we wanted to write this part here we'd have to you know all the time you're thinking about writing midi parts you know short short short long short short long long short these kind of things and you know it can be difficult to you know you know make hundreds of them per track and hundreds of tracks and everything and you're always trying to think of new midi parts sometimes you know exactly what you want you just want to dot dot you know some stab thing or something little boop boop or you know exactly what you want but a lot of times when you're writing a track you kind of i personally like to you know as i said let let it kind of emerge um and so one of the ways i'll do this is by making a few different parts with this random setup you can get different notes in different places let the pattern kind of emerge and then you go in there and fix it a bit before you know and and and remove some overlaps so um we've got our basic pattern here and so now what i want to do is i want to modulate some different things and so let's just say if we were to put something to the cutoff frequency so now in there's a couple ways to do random stuff here you could use the chaos which would be on a sample

if we were to put something to the cutoff frequency so now in there's a couple ways to do random stuff here you could use the chaos which would be on a sample and hold so on a time division but that will only do it on the time divisions the thing here is since some notes are going to be longer and some are going to be shorter we would want i kind of want each let's well let's hear what it sounds like so if we do if we go to the matrix and we put the source as chaos one and go to our filter cut off and put it up now when we go here so it's moving around but it's always going to do it on whatever division we choose so we've chosen it was oh i have to do bpm sync so if we do it at eighth notes so every 16th note is going to be a different one and sometimes the notes are longer so you're hearing it's changing in the middle of the note in the middle whereas we would rather have each note be its own thing so instead of that we can choose um note on rand and so this will give us a random note each time the note is played so that's doing a lot better job because we're not getting it moving in the um so if each when each node plays it's going to have a random value and then the next note is going to have a different value so what if we also apply that to something else say we could do the wave table position on this or we could put this one here slow down so i've just put a slow one here moving the wave table position around so not only are we going to be getting a different note on each different band pass a different cutoff frequency value but this is going to be spanning around as well you also could put say we could try putting so the um note on random so some other things as well what if we put it to the um oscillator a um amount of the oops it's going to be oscillator so now this is going to be moving as well and if we do it more or say if we want to go negative direction so now we can see different fm values as well do do so i want to do one more i'm going to also make i want to have a note on random um we have a second one so it's going to be slightly different random not the same one i'm gonna put this one just to the oscillator i mean so the um envelope um release so that sometimes we get a little longer notes here uh now we have i have put a delay on here but i'm actually going to turn these effects off because what we want here is so this is randomly this this part is is i didn't write it it's randomly um playing different notes so what i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna duplicate a larger area and then i'm going to record this so i'm just going to export this out as serum fm1 still on sierra make sure everything's set and export so because we did it using this little midi modifier note length and density trick we're basically saying okay within this time play how many did i have uh play one third of the notes randomly select them approximately one third and then each time choose a different note length now i just want to show you here if we choose a much higher note length and then i record this again we will see a different you'll see some longer notes come through and also let's do i like sometimes to have a higher density and then even a really low density so that you can kind of tease in the part you also can delete them but let's see what happens when we do it like this so now we're gonna have a couple longer notes and it's gonna be a different um you'll see so that's just an example of how when we set the different parameters you'll get different things coming out so this is less notes than this one and obviously they've come up in different places because it's random so i'm just going to mute i'm going to actually put that onto the same channel so we have it here so now i'm going to put on the effects to this channel so", "start_char_idx": 7096, "end_char_idx": 11640, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n",

we that way when we want to delete some of these parts we can delete them so let's go we just have a little ping pong i have it set up to 1 8 dotted now it's also first step is put on our eq okay decent and adjust the volume and usually just with the basic volume things at the beginning i will just make sure that it's not louder than anything that's there so usually like if the i don't want it to be louder than the kick or the bass um and somewhere in there you'll see especially at the end when we go through and clean up things we'll really dial it all in but for now i just want to make sure that you know it's not louder than any of the other parts so i've got this lines at negative 12 as long as it's around there it's good so we're getting some louder notes and some smaller notes we could compress this we could do some other stuff but for now we're just going to let it go and so now i just want to show you why i did two so if i wanted this sound and i was kind of trying to lead it in i might not start out with the one that has all of the different notes i might do the one that had less notes first if this will not lag okay so in the first section and then already so we can hear in this one i'm gonna go through and clean everything up and just choose which ones you like move the ones you don't so those first ones are good i don't think we need those that one's good but maybe we put it over here a little bit earlier so that they're coming in at the right you know at a different place in the in the phrase so don't need that one those are good and let's see what it sounds like with these other guys that we had and we can also maybe put this one for the second area so they're not overlapping if this would let me do it there we go so so already that's sounding decent um and just an example of how so also for this second part here i would probably you know listen through here and there's not all these we're not going to want necessarily all of these but i might leave them now and then add some more parts and then once i have some other part you know a counter point to it because a lot of times what we want is we want you know call-in response and so in the first section you obviously see i've left lots of room for other parts to kind of call in response and for sure at the beginning of a track you'll hear that you want to leave you know as you t as you introduce sounds and we'll get more towards composition ideas later but as you introduce ideas that you don't want them to be too thick at the beginning so you want to leave some more space and then as it fills in and you get going throughout the track that you're going to leave less and less space but still you might want instead of you know these guys going the entire time to have some other sound counterpointing but since i don't have that yet i don't have um i would just leave this one write the other ones and then when i make another part and then i say oh okay this one should happen when this one's not and this one should happen when the other one's not and so i'll go in and delete it but so what we can do now is just go and leave this here we'll drop it up into our folder and so that then we can move on", "start_char_idx": 10692, "end_char_idx": 14856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n",

base so let's jump right into it the first thing I've done here is I've just opened a blank project in Cubase that is my folders so I have my as you guys saw before I have nothing in these folders but I just always start up with my template it's the way I like to work so I've got my kick channel here and we have um it's just it's it's a sample of one that I've made so I'm just going to use this and we'll do kick in another tutorial um so what I've first done is I've put the kick here I've I've made a group Channel this is a folder but I also have my group track here with the kicking Bass um this will be important later but um the first thing is just also I'll route that to the kick bass bus I've created a bass Channel and I've also routed this to the kick and bass bus um and so for the kick right now I have it completely clean no eqs no um um anything no compression nothing like that and so the what I've done here is I like some people like their kicks longer some people like them shorter I like my kicks to be just about a 16th note which is right here it's going to go a little bit over into the um next uh beat but or whether so we're the first base La the first note of the bass line would be and so we're gonna have that fade out and then we're going to use either a little bit of modulation on the base to um take care of that overlap so you can hear the kick nothing special and the first thing that I do is I just set my volume to be of the kick this uh to be negative 10 decibels just good starting point um if you do put your base your kick here and I usually put my bass depending on it around negative 12 decibels so a little bit quieter than the base I mean then the kick and that just gives you a good place because if you then add all your sounds and everything like that you won't have to lower the volume when you finish um the track at the end and here let me just slow it down let's just do 148 BPM okay so the first thing I'm going to do here just to get onto our base is just make a midi um midi window and we're going to [Music] choose what note we want so let's do something I'm going to just do G all right so the first thing is I'm just going to be putting my midi notes here um and so what I want to do is I like I just make them 16th notes and then as a starting point what I do is I'll go up to the smallest division here and make them a little bit shorter so they're long um as possible but they don't go all the way to the next note that way you can use the release to have a little bit of time in between there to shape the end of the note Okay so we've got our midi pattern now the first thing I'm going to do is I I have um a base set up but I'm just going to start from scratch here so the first I'm going to do is just to show you guys how a basic the um see where is silent one okay the basic way that you make a base on any synthesizer and I'm going to use uh nope we're going to use silent because it's just super easy so if I'm here and we just need to get to first um the go to four choose an initial patch no preset [Music] okay so we just have our initial patch here and we are uh what we're gonna do is we're just going to use one oscillator so this one here we have it on saw which is all we need um now we can pitch it the octave down here maybe to get it more where we want and so then the basically we just need a filter here at a uh low pass and so a base inside trans is just applying a modulation envelope to the filter so if we put this here and so we choose filter cut off a go all the way up pull the sustain down and then we pull the cut off frequency down here we don't need any resonance so now you'll hear as we move the Decay time up you start to get the base to come through and so this is just the filter an envelope going on that cut cut off so the first thing you want to do is start here put this up and then find where you want that you can hear that and you want to get that around where you want it you can add a little bit of sustain so that the note holds after and the tiniest bit of release as well and then what you want to do is it's a combination of playing with this the",

the basically we just need a filter here at a uh low pass and so a base inside trans is just applying a modulation envelope to the filter so if we put this here and so we choose filter cut off a go all the way up pull the sustain down and then we pull the cut off frequency down here we don't need any resonance so now you'll hear as we move the Decay time up you start to get the base to come through and so this is just the filter an envelope going on that cut cut off so the first thing you want to do is start here put this up and then find where you want that you can hear that and you want to get that around where you want it you can add a little bit of sustain so that the note holds after and the tiniest bit of release as well and then what you want to do is it's a combination of playing with this the Decay time and the cutoff frequency so if you want it more open higher if you want it closed lower usually you want it very near to the bottom okay so basically mod envelope affecting the cutoff of one filter that is the basic basic way that you will create a base in anything whether you're going to use silence whether you're going to use serum whether you're going to use Dune which is another one which is really great it's basically just this one thing modulating or tweaking the mod the filter envelope so that's it but now I'm gonna go to show you guys because what I really want to focus here on is not just this part because this is you know uh just the beginning step the next step is how you shape that using EQ using um uh especially the most important one for a side trans space is going to be multiband saturate or distortions um so we'll show you that so I'm going to go into I'm going to go back from Silent I'm going to open up uh trillion which uh you have to it's it's a bit of an expensive thing but it's really great um for making base because it has samples from um lots of legendary synthesizers and other sources so you really have a lot and and then you can control it the same way that I just showed you so basically here on my main one I've got the ARP 2600 Sawtooth and here is our filter envelope down here and we just turn the filter on put the cut off down see here we go I've this one it's on power filter 24 there's a bunch of different ones here in the low pass you can try all different kinds of ones so then again the it's doesn't matter what synth you're using it's this so you just gotta dial it in to where you want it okay and then just going to go over and just quickly check the level it's a little loud I know it's perfect see it's about negative 12 right there that is where we like it so to start this is okay one thing I'm gonna do is just reduce this we only need one voice we want mono and you don't ever want any resonance on this filter you just so usually you're going to want it all the way down and play with this and you see right when you get onto the line of where you want it it'll start to feel like it lags a little bit because that's it the Decay taking longer than the division of time so if you want that better listen for it somewhere around here okay so now we're gonna go and I'm gonna walk you through one by one some different um options for what we want to do which is putting on some multi-band Distortion so Cubase has this great one called quadrupuzz if anybody uh is familiar if you know about Forest music and things like this you'll know that um quadrifuz the original version which you can't use anymore on newer versions of Cubase was legendary for the bass you just basically drop it on and it sounds amazing um and especially for uh the other Steinberg uh vb1 so you put vb1 with the original quadrophos and there it is now things have come a long way and so uh we can do a lot more than just that but still this second version of quadrupuzz is very nice so basically what I'm I have it's it's a multi-band so we got four different bands here and um I have it on the tape selection here so if we just turn it on off on off on and here so this is giving us a nice line we can you can hear the Distortion the drive certain channels more but you really don't need a lot we just want real subtle again A B off on now what you can do here is you can play around with these frequencies and move these cutoffs and you hear how it's going to do a lot to change the sound what I", "start_char_idx":

just want real subtle again A B off on now what you can do here is you can play around with these frequencies and move these cutoffs and you hear how it's going to do a lot to change the sound what I try to do is put them in between not on top of a peak and I'll show you a little bit in the next and Saturn how to do it even more specifically so for example this is quantifas now for people who don't use Cubase we have Fab filter Saturn as you can see it's a similar similar thing we're going on here I am going to use what I like to do is actually use both of them and have a mix so I have the tape on quadrifuz and then over here I'm going to use two and so basically let's turn this on you hear what that's doing as well and so now I have the quadrupuzz muted so we're just going to do one and then this is a great way as well you can use these to adjust the levels of the Bands so that's you can hear if we have it even zero zero zero a lot of times you have a little too much bass and we'll look at a spectrum analyzer afterwards to see this but so you can use this to pull out and mix the frequencies in a way that's a little different than using a parametric EQ or a high pass filter so here I have no drive on the top one no drive on the lower just drive here on the middle and now what I like to do with Saturn is get this just look online for note frequency charts basically this is super handy thing to have which just shows the actual frequency for different notes the frequencies of every octave and so what we're going to do here is I'm going to since uh my Baseline is in G I want to put this crossover and this crossover in between the octaves so G it's going to be a 49.98 so let's see here it's going to be using the 98 so it's right around there already we can type it in if we want and then the next one this one is in the 7 800 range so we're going to uh we're going to put it onto um let's see this one 783 this is the right octave the fifth octave so let's go around 783 all right now let's try them together nice very nice and then again you can play with the relative levels here on both of them it's gonna be the mix amount here so you see we can pull out the base if we think there's too much low end we can remove it with either one of these guys and we can move these around as well if we want to try different crossovers now it's usually better if you leave the first ones and then go into the next range and then this is 1.8 so let's take a look back at our chart what's around G for 1 8 so that's 1567. so let's move this guy down a little bit there we go all right so tape and Tube only really adding any drive to the middle on this one and using the band levels to pull the bass down just a little bit so we don't have too much low end next I'm going to show you um a free plug-in called the 1973 Stillwell EQ um there are many like this this is just an example of one which basically um what I want to do here sorry I should be showing you guys this whole time let's get uh the pro Q3 open so first of all let's go ahead and that's my default as we talked about in the other videos Okay so let's look if we have off and then we turn on now you can see from the shape here that it's pretty good we've got a lot a little bit extra here that is kind of humping up that we don't need to see how we can move things here okay so now we're going to use go back to

dip around here in the uh between 200 and 400 or depending on the Baseline but you really want it on the uh like third to fifth harmonics here so if we hold on top of this you can see so we're going to want to dip out these guys a little bit and that's what I have here so I have this is just set to nothing this is a high shelf which is down a little bit but the main thing I'm using here is a um EQ at 360. so if we see that's going to be right about here and see we have this little it's going to pull this range down and the difference between doing it with a parametric like I could just put it like this but this is going to impact the frequencies over here and over here some of these nice old emulations um plug-ins emulate Hardware that it's a bit more subtle and it's obviously not as clean but the way that it does it it'll pull out some of the frequencies in a way that adds character and um doesn't distort it and add artifacts so we're gonna do that and basically what I'm doing here is as you can see pulling out a little bit on the top above 12. and then here now look at that you see here and so now depending on the type of Baseline you might want a lot of this or not much but for sure you can see when it's flat and it looks like a hill here it's too much mid-range now if I just go see how we're getting this little dip here and then it goes back up this is what we're looking for and then again if you want more some like dark bass lines really take it out even more I'm gonna go about here okay um let's just move this up okay now while we're here with the looking at this what we want to do if you're going to be using any EQ parametric EQ you want to put it into natural sorry linear phase zero latency is the normal way it's gonna distort um and and and for example if you put a high pass it's going to create a big resonant Peak at the high pass frequency so if we put this to something sharper just to give it so you can tell if we were on zero you can hear that you see how it's actually boosting this right here we don't want that we want to cut but without boosting anything we don't want to create a resonant Peak so what we're going to do is we're going to put this onto linear phase and now you can hear all I'm really doing is as you can see pulling this here also I don't need I don't want to affect this too much so I'm going to move this down underneath where about somewhere between 27 to 32 Hertz is usually where I do it no resonance linear phase so you don't even hear that which is what you want we just want to get a little bit of this low stuff out of there and again remember if we want to remove the low we can pull out using our bands here um now somebody asked this in the um on the comments about from the last video you'll see some people will go into the kick and they will or end the base and they will do you know loads of little points like this to try to make you know where you're removing the overlap you look at one at the kick and you and you make these put these in the cake you put them just to fit them like puzzle pieces together personally I don't like to do this because I think that you're really adding um you're changing it too much the thing is if you look at a base and you can see it right here I'm going to just delete all these points these each the sound is very distinct each Peak is distinct from each other and so if you start messing with these things you're going to mess with harmonics you're going to change the way that it it um it sounds and so again doing it obviously with these guys is going to do it as well doing it with the um uh Distortion units but it's going to do it in a way where it's going to affect all of the frequencies rather than specific frequencies so I get a much more natural and warm sound and in general my ethos is less is more especially when dealing with the bass so um this is the basic thing that I do there I have one other little secret sauce thing that I will use which is this is the uad voice of God by little Labs which if many of people that might have used um let's say rbase Max Base these things from waves but these things will make it money and a

trying to fatten up your base but you don't actually want to fatten up your base too much you want it to be nice and quote unquote fat but not fat in your studio fat on the PA system and your studio you're going to be using near field monitors that don't have a subtle filter even if you do have a subwoofer you know it's supposed to be a much flatter response when you're in a studio listening when you're out at in a car even or at your friend's house or out of a PA system they're going to have tons of bass so if you boosted your base too much and there's any amount of mud it's just gonna it's just gonna be the whole thing will be mud so it's better to have a nice tight clean base that maybe sounds not pumping enough on small systems because on a big system it's going to be there whereas if you have too much bass so that it sounds good out of your you know uh laptop or in your sound say perfect on your studio monitors it's going to have way too much bass um when you're actually out in a PA system so don't get caught this this whole you know I need the base to be more fat more fat yeah I don't know how we got to this place because actually you know cleaner is better than fatter what and again also depends on the type of music like Asterix is gonna get a way better base than uh me because he's working 10 15 BPM slower so there's more time for the base um to develop it has more space and so it can be louder and have more present because there will be little more cycles that of the that can complete um and so for you know faster music 150 bpm and higher we're getting into this really uh short time frame where each note doesn't have a lot of time and so there's going to be a upper limit to how much bass you can get and still have it be clean um so uh don't try to get too much too much mud so I'm going to show you this little plug-in and um this is something that basically I use it at like five percent so I'll show you do you hear anything barely right that's what we want now I'm going to turn the amplitude on this thing all the way up just so you can hear and I don't know if you can see but it's really warming it up and then we can move the frequency so you see I'm making a huge bump here and if I move it that's moving up right so I'm going to find the frequency I want to boost see now this is down here and this is up here so I want to kind of give just a little bit under you know boost this area and then I'm just going to put the amplitude down to literally one out of ten so you barely hear it just to give a little bit of a boost so for people who don't have that plug-in don't worry about it it's the least important thing that I've done so now one other thing you're gonna do when I went into my um I started it and I just made my notes Here all have the same velocity but oh so here's the key thing now we're going to test and see how this is actually looking we also can look let's get a smex this makes a scope okay oh sorry some extra soap we got to put it onto the kick base so now this is why we put the kick and base together so we have the kick base bus here so we have our kick and our base coming in very nice bigger okay so um we are

gonna do so if we have the kick is playing if we solo it it is coming in here at 10. and if we go up to our kick and base bus we should be seeing the", "start_char_idx": 14471, "end_char_idx": 18814,

one other thing you're gonna do when I went into my um I started it and I just made my notes Here all have the same velocity but oh so here's the key thing now we're going to test and see how this is actually looking we also can look let's get a smex this makes a scope okay oh sorry some extra soap we got to put it onto the kick base so now this is why we put the kick and base together so we have the kick base bus here so we have our kick and our base coming in very nice bigger okay so um we are watching this and that's looking pretty good our kick is still there so we've routed the kick to kick and bass bus we've routed the base to the kick and bass bus now here's the first check that we're gonna do so if we have the kick is playing if we solo it it is coming in here at 10. and if we go up to our kick and base bus we should be seeing the same number now let's unmute the base sometimes if your base is overlapping in a bad way with your kick like like let's say if we take oops this kick to all of them so if I make the kick all the way longer and now go back up to the kick and base and actually I want to just turn this up a little bit okay so yeah you're getting a little bit but we're basically we have the kick is short the point I'm not getting the overlap that I wanted to show you but basically the point is that you don't want the two things to sum to more than the individual part so if I mute the base and I mute the kick individually and then we check their volume they shouldn't up you see that's doing something so we do have a little bit of this changing here so what we're going to do is I'm going to go down to the base and I'm gonna put on a little bit of a side chain this is just going to make the first note I have a little bit less volume the other way you could do this is by also you could put the volume down I mean the velocity down on the first note but this is gonna then change the feel more and just so you guys if talk about something different for doing certain patterns and stuff you want you can play with these like for example if we want to sound the Parvati feel do it even more if we grab the first and the last but now we're getting this one let's just go back to basically normal so we could do it two ways you could do it just with the velocity or the way that I like to do it is a little bit of both so put the velocity down and then we'll also put on the other photo now I will say I'm doing this on my headphones which is not how I usually mix my kicking base um just because I'm making the video um so hopefully it also sounds super killer up there but I'm showing you guys my like tried and true technique so I'm pretty comfortable that it also sounds good um and so to go back over one last thing here so I have my fab filter here but you know to be honest actually done do you hear a big difference you're getting a little bit out here but it's total it's not completely necessary and sometimes it's nice to not have a low pass and just to use even with a linear phase but just to leave no EQ I have well I have the 1973 on here doing a little bit but it's very clean and it's mostly coming through now if I just gonna mute if I turn off the quadrupuzz and Fab filter there what what happened to the base you know what I mean this bass sounds garbage now and so for me the way that I do it is using these combinations and so if you didn't have quadrifuz you could use two Saturns have one Saturn with say three bands like this on tube and do another Saturn with uh different bands on tape and then also you can see here that you can adjust the individual frequencies for the different bands so I've put a little bit up and then coming down here you could just do play with these all different ways so you can actually EQ each different band um individually just one last thing I didn't really mention um but yeah so if you've actually seen I don't know if anybody watched uh Brainiac uh has uh some master class and when he's doing it he does this as well um he has multiple multiband distortions and so I think he uses two or three Saturns to do it so um you know it really helps to shape it so let's turn this back on and see what happens a little better way better okay so we've gotten and so then the reason I actually want to show you so I've turned off the high pass here now what I like to do is I'm going to go into

do is I'm going to go into the kick and bass channel here and I have a Fab filter that I've put on the kick and bass because if any of people have ever done oh God no don't quit all right guys I think I'm just gonna bail here it's uh it's gonna quit so the last thing I wanted to talk about um ah forget it just bear with me for one second guys I don't think I saved super close to that but anyways it's we'll do it again so uh this is a good moment to remind everybody uh save all the freaking time because yeah I just I didn't I don't think I saved that for a while um let's see tutorial Space tutorial newer so we have new backup let's just do that see what it's saved a little more recently okay so while waiting for this basically what I was going to say is just that I put a um a pro-q3 with the linear phase to use as my filter basically so if you want a high pass filter low pass filter and do sweeps on your kicking base so all right let's just go should have everything's set up decently [Music] close enough close enough to just keep going on and show you guys what I was the next things so if we go back up to the kicking base and we see we have a Fab filter here so this one I've set up this linear phase and so I'll use this if I want to do like if you want to do a high sweep right because if you use a filter or something like that you're gonna get the same issue you get as I showed you before you're going to get resident Peaks at that frequency so if you want to just move it out and have it clean and not stored it at all just do it like this use a high pass and a low pass linear phase and if you just leave it see if they're above and below that doesn't make a difference and you just leave that on and then I automate these with automation channels here [Music] anyways so do that now we're going to have to I'm going to show you the thing that you want to do at the very end so some people talked about multi-sampling and putting your kick you know doing every single note for example I've only been on one note here so let's go ahead and let's just say what if we do the octave thing you know do do Okay so usually what I do in this the envelopes are going to be a different size so you can um the higher frequency is going to be a different volume everything's going to be different usually if I'm doing around within a few notes it's not that big of a difference [Music] and mostly you'll find that if I personally like to work with synthesizers rather than um samples because then if you want a long if you could just you have more flexibility but I will clean them up at the end which I'll show you however it depends on what you want to use certain uh since they're not totally they make a great they have great way for them they sound good but they're not stable so in that case you might want to sample out one waveform or one one cycle one note and then or just a long note holding it like that and put that into a sampler and do it and you can multi-sample out every notes and you know this is great the thing is it's a lot of work for every single track and you know to be honest that it's not totally necessary it depends if your base is all over the place where you're gonna have to fix that but there are many ways to do it usually what I'll do is I will separate my base into two different channels so say I just have this we're going to go with the octave one right here right what I will do is duplicate [Music] and one take out the high notes and the other particular notes take out the high notes so now we have base High and we can see then we", "start_char_idx": 21442, "end_char_idx": 25909, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name":

we have base High and we can see then we can just we have a whole other channel for this so if we want we can move these see now we're not totally in the middle of the phrase here and the main thing is we're going to see the volume is too high so you can see the high note is oh I think the base is louder also I didn't see so kick is that negative 10 let's get this guy 11.5 and so then this is negative 2.74 let's put this down like negative 3.5 and let's see how that sounds [Music] and so then the thing is we can go in and we can tweak this one different so actually the main place that it's going to matter is the uh length of the decay so we go in here to our filter envelope so now we're just affecting the middle note right [Music] so we can affect the length of this independently from the length of the other ones and so then also you know if I make my pattern I'll sometimes you know I'm just doing high notes and low notes here but basically all set at the top half of the octave can go to the high notes and the lower half of the octave can go to the low notes now one other thing I want to show you and um I'm gonna just uh let's do it on well actually we can we can put both of these together so now what we're going to do is base High both of them are going to the kick and bass so I'm going to show you one last very important thing about dealing with your base so I'm going to record the uh group of the kick and Bass with no kick just because I want to get both the high and the low and the same one together and let's go base audio I'm going to also convert this at this moment to MIDI I mean uh sorry mono and I'm going to put the bit depth make sure it's 44 1 24 bit or whatever your sample whatever you're working in let's make sure that there's not going to the desktop but it's going to the project audio folder and let's insert it to the audio in audio track all right so we bounce we have the audio down on the bottom now let's go ahead and mute the midi channels and we can see exactly what is our problem here so when you put all of these distortions onto your base you're going to first of all there's going you see how the bass sometimes when it records if we look in here there's a delay it's not actually triggering or starting on the uh first of the 16th note so what we can do we can adjust that and move it forward now I will say that I does not always need to be exactly here you'll you got to use your ear a lot of times I actually like a little bit of a delay because that's where it sounds right and you're going to have to just every every synth and uh Sound Source is different I'm going to give you a slightly different waveform but so before we play with the front there I just also want to show you that this is the other problem is that we see we have this big tail here all of this is now overlapping with the kick so now if we go and we do our kick soloed and we look at the kick bass Channel we have that and now if we put the base audio in oh I have to put it to the kicking base you can see that we're now higher because this is hitting where this is also if we go ahead and look at a smex Mexico scope gotta get the trigger to line up anyways you can see a little bit here it's a little difficult but um the point that I wanted that I'm trying to make is that it's actually better to show you just here on the waveform because you see the kick here is now going to overlap with this and so these are going to sum together and they're", "start_char_idx": 24989, "end_char_idx": 29355, "text_template":

because you see the kick here is now going to overlap with this and so these are going to sum together and they're going to change it and you're going to get a little squeezing of the kick at the beginning and you don't want that you want the kick to hit 100 clean so we're going to do two things here the first thing is let's go ahead and just move over this um let's see I actually am not going for the well here let's let's try this we go over to this point and now if we put it oops you are all right so that is good I moved it Forward on and as I said though we can try I'm gonna just move to a little small too late I actually think it's even better here see this is where it initially was I'm Gonna Leave it where it originally was where the timing is automatically so this is what I what I really want to show you here is not about that because you can adjust that on your own the point I want to make here is if we go to 16th is specifically about this tail so in Cubase is a great thing what you can do is if you switch to the scissors and then you press on a Mac it's alt and you click in one place it's going to break it all into that many pieces so what I want to do is break the entire thing into one beat then I go back to by hitting one I move to the cursor go here select oh just need to go to the end because there is one little tiny I don't know if you can see that this stupid thing let's delete okay so then and imagine my track is you know super long here so I have a million of these but I'm doing it at the very end and so you select all events and it grabs all of your bass and then you just move the first one back so you see how it's now removed this overlap and then we can use our Fades to just fade us in here and then on the tail side it's going to be really important and if you want to zoom in it can sometimes help because we want to go and get this down to a zero Crossing so I'm going to go like that but not affect it too much that looks good so now when the kick hits it's getting clean and if we go back to our specs of scope you'll see it's hidden clear okay so this is very important at the very end remove the Tails from the base so that the bit the um the kick hits cleanly and this is this is hugely important because otherwise your kick is going to be off um so let's just quickly go over everything from the beginning so remember that no matter what synth you're using basically the key thing is a low pass filter using the Decay um to uh modulate the amount to start just using the amount of the Decay to say how much of the high frequencies come through and that's really going to give you the tone of your base and then your key players in making it sounds super killer are going to be things like quadrifies Saturn other multi-band Distortion units where you're going to put multiple points use more than one of them if you like you'll get different results with them all try all different combinations tape tube combinations of the both but these are the key things and again we can use this to add some drive and Distortion a little bit to certain frequencies and we can also use it as a way to um to do some eq'ing even though we're not using an equalizer we're going to be you know I'm pulling out a couple decibels of the of the base here and then uh something like this some sort of not parametric but some sort of shaping EQ to pull out that range around 300 Hertz so that you can um because that's that you so you don't get this little buzz ringing guy and then if you have something like it you can use uh something that you know is a base resonance tool or the max space but if you do", "start_char_idx": 28445, "end_char_idx": 32885, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

resonance tool or the max space but if you do use these things use them a very very lightly and then depending on the type of Base you can add your uh side chain and there's lots of different ways to do the side chain but a side chain or you can play with the velocity of the actual notes um and the playing of the velocity of the notes and the length of the notes is going to give you lots of different types of um uh feels you know also again if you move you know for example going back to that Brainiac video he does um he makes like uh 140 BPM daytime kind of stuff so when he does the three bass notes he puts the first one all the way down in the last two the velocity down and the next two up so you know there's going to get that really like gallopy feel um there's all different kinds of bass lines we can go over that kind of thing in another one but you can play with the velocity as well and then for my technique of doing with the high notes because I'm using trillion which is very stable is to just separate out the top half of the octave with the bottom half of the octave so that I can adjust the decay of the higher pitch notes a little bit and then also if you want to you can adjust the crossover points on the multiband Distortion and if you need to any EQ but anyways you can deal with the higher notes separately from the lower notes then finally at the end bounce it to mono and if you need to shift left or right to change the uh where the starting point is do that otherwise the main key thing is to remove this area where the tail will be overlapping with the kick so you can get a nice clean Kick Drum so that's it um please uh don't hesitate to question comment anything you guys have to go into further um I hope this was helpful and please let me know if there's anything you guys want me to revisit uh or show you in the next video on bass lines have a great day guys take care", "start_char_idx": 31960, "end_char_idx": 34749, "text_template":

"RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "welcome everybody today I'm going to be showing you uh how to make a simple patch an FM patch on a modular and um here it's going to sound like this when we're finished [Music] okay so now I'm going to turn off the bass and the kick and come over here and we're gonna work on it together so the first thing that I want to show you is so basically what we're using is we are using the um dual Precision vco from radical frequencies which is a great dual oscillator could use any anything that's a dual oscillator but this is just a real simple one straightforward that sounds great so I'm going to show you that so first thing I'm going to do just I'm going to break the patch out just so you can we can just hear what's happening directly um from this end so basically what we have yep so this is our output from the saw here and it's just going into this oscilloscope here and then I'm going right into the output down here okay so this it's got X exponential and linear FM and I'm running them both so we can just try to see what it sounds like that's with no FM that's linear and exponential right so the first thing that we want to do is we want to tune the oscillator so what I have here is I have I'm just running the other the first so basically what this is the one oscillator then gets goes to through the other and so this is the carrier and this is the modulator the second one and we're running out the modulator so the carrier one is is going to set the um the tune of it so I'm just running this this orange one you'll see here is going into the second channel so if we now go to this and we'll just put it on to tuner and if we go over to the 2 so here now if we play with this you'll see we can tune it so I'm going to tune it to an a because that's what the bass is in so I'm just playing with the fine tune here all right so now we've got our first oscillator tuned so now the second oscillator what happens here is this changes basically it's like the ratio essentially of the exponential FM this is actually it but it's just the further apart the more ripping it'll get right so now what I'm doing is in order to get a gated sound right instead of going directly into the output here I'm going to wire it back in I'm going through this really cool little low pass gate so instead of using an awesome I mean an envelope um like an adsr basically if you feed this different a CV I'm taking the gate from my micro midi umidy um here sorry this humidity this takes signal from the DAW and I'm running that into the CV so basically different note length right will trigger the low pass gate then I'm running it into a high pass filter just to add a little bit more um modulation there we can play with it but you could just run it straight out but so um now I'm so if we take this instead of going out there we go take the output of our oscilloscope of our you know tuner oscilloscope so we just want to watch what's going on so now if we go back to the oscilloscope seen the first one and now if I take we've got the output going into the filter and so if I take the high pass filter here and then now I just need to hit play on the Daw to make it uh run so let me do that and turn it up okay so now we're getting our pattern here and I'm using a note length and gate note length modified here let me just show you this for a sec so if we go over to the computer if we come over here I'm using the density control so just 16th notes and I'm using the midi modifiers see here to change the value of the note length okay so now back over here now so what I showed you is that if we move this we get different cool sounds so now what I'm doing is I'm taking the um using this it's a sample and hold random by intro and I'm going to run that into the um voltage volts proactive of this so now if we find a thing and then I'm using it in unipolar here can switch it to bipolar so you can see up and down [Music] so this is the amount so every time we get uh um a gate a note it's going to trigger a different value here quite simple and then I'm running another one which is doing the same thing over here to the frequency of our high pass just to give another little modulation there and this is the ssf Randstad so also taking just split out the clock from the trigger here okay so triggering it and then so now what we can do is find our little sweet spot here so I'm going to put it back to unipolar so", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4417, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

[Music] okay now I'm going to make the density a little bit less here I mean more so you hear more notes coming through so I'm putting the density at like 77 80 now see that's gonna be too high if we put the mount down a little bit and switch [Music] I kind of just like it going higher gives that nice [Applause] feel so very cool huh and this pitch doesn't matter because it's just a tone Timbre kind of you can play with different this is like the range we kind of get down here [Music] [Applause] if we put this a little bit lower then we're gonna get a little bit more range and then put the sample and hold them out higher okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to record a sample of this um so then we can put it into the track and and see what it looks like so I'm just going to hit record on Cubase over here and here let me show you so back over in Cubase now I'm going to record one take [Applause] foreign enough this is just to take here that I did before so now the one thing I want to show you is um so I'm going to just move this down to another channel so we're not messing with our input there our input Channel turn that off and mute this for a second so now if I come in here the one thing I want to show you is I you know there's sometimes a little bit of record latency I have that it's very small but when I hit record it just you know delays the recording a little bit I have my settings in but I just go in and I just do it afterwards it's really not that big of a deal it's a little Annoying if you're trying to track multiple Parts at once but you know it's not the end of the world so now if I move that actually that one might not be the bet well yeah see now you see here we're we're right on right on the grid there so um now let me just move this out of the way here because I had put um a delay here so now if we go into this Channel and um play that I just put a dubstation ping pong delay okay I can mute everything first and also I put a send so I'll just mute that for a second so now if we hear it and we can add in the kick in the base so you can hear [Music] a little louder okay pretty cool and now if we add in the dub station [Music] [Applause] now so I'm gonna put this one back here I'm going to put on the layers Lanes I mean show you so I had this one or this one and then a little bit of uh Reverb [Applause] [Music] now let's hear it with some percussion [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you all right so that is how you do it a pretty simple patch [Music] but um very cool I like it and I'm gonna just come back in here to show you one more time in the synth so just to recap remember it's basically just tuning the first sauce sorry tuning the first oscillator to the key then setting using an FM to then modulate the uh voltage per octave volts per Octave of the um channel that is the the carrier for I mean the modulator and using a sample and hold for that that is then going each time there's Gates and then I'm running into a low pass gate here now what we could do another way is you could keep it inside the Box by you know instead of um look here I'll just show you that right now let me mute everything and come back in here and", "start_char_idx": 3538, "end_char_idx": 7722, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n",

gate we're going to go here we're going to send the signal through a VCA instead right and then we can use this very cool thing native mutable instruments Peaks the first one with the Dead Man's catch firmware so this is a random ad so now if we take instead of taking the gates and um actually we'll just keep everything the same so we're going to keep the gates and stuff but instead of doing a random gate length I'm just gonna have to make this a little bit longer need a longer cable so we take the gate and we come over it doesn't matter if it's a getter trig but we come over to this this Peaks and put the trigger in there and then we will send the output of this to our CV in here so now if we run this and oh I have to [Music] okay now I'm just going to put turn off the density and the midi modifier so they're just straight notes and then what we can do [Applause] so this is the length here right longer right and this is the attack here and this is the Decay this is the random Decay and this is a random velocity [Music] [Applause] so by putting a bit of delay right and then we can play with different things here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] okay I like that so I'm gonna take a recording of this now and let's see what we've got over here so let's just record do one loop on it in over in Ableton I mean in Cubase [Applause] okay so now here if I come back and show you Ableton again oops to show you Amino Cubase I want to keep saying Ableton so now again um here I'll just put it next to it here so the same thing we just want to go in oops and we just want to make sure that the first little point we're starting where we want and you can see again my record latency it's there just slightly so we'll just take that there and then put it and I'm just gonna just so we have the different sections I'm going to put it down here actually we can do the lanes again ah no let's just set it up keep going make a longer Loop all right so now let's hear what happened there cool and now let's hear [Applause] okay [Music] cool [Music] see another cool way also [Music] [Applause] and then we've got oh yeah let me just put them all next to each other so we see them all thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] cool so that's the faster with less density there I mean foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right well I hope you all enjoyed this

midi note base midi note lines um without writing them out by hand so uh the first thing I'm going to show you here is just I've got a basic track open in Cubase I've got a kick and a bass and I'm going to be using the virus TI for the sound but this this doesn't really matter you could use anything here so the first thing it's just going to set up quick sound so that we have something to trigger so I've got the initial patch here and um if we play a note it sounds like sorry about that if we play note it sounds like this all right so that's good and but when I'm just going to make it a little bit more crunchy by just putting the sync on here going FM so now this one's running through this one and we put the semitone down a little bit uh so the this octave is down we've got a pretty nice little sound right there uh nothing else to do for now um just to set that up so here's comes to the meat of this lesson what we're going to do is we're going to create a small mini clip here and we are going to put midi notes at every 16th note so my Baseline in this was an F so we're just going to choose the pencil tool and we want 16th notes sorry about that so 16th notes on f one two three four all the way through so now if I play this it's going to be pretty boring but you'll hear what so I think that's probably maybe one octave too low there so let's go ahead and shift this up there we go so basically we just have 16th notes playing every single 16th note and they are all the same length so uh here is where the magic happens if we go over here in Cubase we have this thing called midi modifiers so uh this can be very useful uh first of all if you have an um a line here we can use the transpose to shift it up or down so that can be useful without having to move all your midi notes around if you just want to change the octave but what we're really going to use here is this little random Matrix here so you have two Targets and you can choose position pitch velocity and length and this is the one that's really going to help us make our midi lines so if we choose length now we have a max length and a Min length and these can roughly correspond to uh you know like a the 16th note or a half a sixteenth note at certain tempos but basically what I found is you can just kind of play it by ear I tend to around 30 seems to be about making it one time longer so if you want it or half as long so 60 would be about twice as long 90 would be one and a half or two and a half times long and so on and so forth but it depends on your Tempo so uh really you can just play around with it so what we're going to do here is we're going to make the max value let's make it say 60 for now and we'll have some shorter Notes too so basically this is saying that some of the notes can be shorter than the 16th note and some can be longer and we're allowing a little bit more length to be bigger than smaller so now if I hit play on this you'll hear what happened all right so we get some longer notes there and if I just make it even longer you'll hear some extra long notes so already we're getting a midi line to come out of this but the next step is really what's going to make this uh sound very fantastic and be something that you can use over and over again there's a lot of great things here in this midi insert section but the one that we're going to focus on right now is called density so basically the density is at a hundred percent so what that means is that it will play 100 of these notes if we then go back to density and we pull it down to say 50 percent now it's going to only play 50 percent of these half of the notes and it'll randomly select which ones to do and then our midi modifier is going to for each node triggered randomly select its length so somewhere from negative 30 to 120.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3968, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator":

put it down even lower say to 20 now you really hear a lot of negative space coming out thank you so that is the gist of it and remember in our thing here we have really nothing going on it's just you know these two oscillators a little FM just to give us a little grit but what you could do then is you know to get a little movement on it just for example here let's say we put uh we've got our high low pass filter here and we just put this triangle LFO it's already there let's just put some to filter one so now we're going to get a little movement if we put a density back up you'll hear them and then we play around with these numbers all right cool right anyway this is just the beginning you can have any number of patches and this is a cool thing too because say here you know I've got my um you know I've got some presets in here for my stuff so if I were to just pick one uh and play it foreign so that is again all the notes are being selected with this random thing and you can choose any sound and it will make a meeting line for you and every single time it will be different because it's always randomly selecting now this is just the beginning of what you can do with these midi modifiers you don't have to do it as 16th notes you could do them as eighth notes and the same thing would happen it would randomly select some of them to play and the note lengths would be randomly selected as well if we go back in here there's you also have some other choices you can do velocity which will you know so now some of these would be a little bit quieter and some will be randomly selected to be a little bit louder they also have a pitch control however this one um is if you do it here and choose notes these are going to be semitones so this would be 12 semitones up and 12 semitones down if you do it like this uh let me go back to our initial patch so then what did I do I had a little bit of FM here and back down with the LFO going uh to the filter one okay so now if you hear we're gonna have random pitch [Music] which you know it's not bad the only thing here is that it's not in a key it's going to be playing any semitone so this is where the midi inserts can be really useful there is an option for a midi modifier in the midi inserts which you'll see is basically the same the only difference is this one if you were to choose the pitch you can choose a scale so we could choose Arabian Dorian major minor whole ton of scales so let's just pick Arabian and we're in F so let's choose F now so now if I put 12 12 semitones or let's just pick down six and let's go up for C get a little more here so now [Music] so it's randomly selecting pitches but it's only choosing notes in the Arabian scale of f so this can be really useful if you want to do some random pitch modulation but could keep it within a scale but the main thing I wanted to show you and the focus of this is how to create random note lengths and using the density control to randomly select a percentage of the notes to play through and if I just put in the kicking bass here now too let's see what we got [Music] [Music] all right so you can see that a little uh I didn't write any note any anything myself but we've got a nice little midi line there and as I said this can be reproduced with any synth anything and it's just a way to have the computer program help you to make the lines so you get a little bit of control Randomness in there so that is the end of this lesson and uh check back for another one I'm going to show you the same technique using Ableton Live with Max for live plugins and then also check back we've got a whole bunch of videos I'm going to go big dig a little deeper into the virus as well as other stuff so stay tuned and thanks for watching thanks everyone",

"class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "hey everybody kabian here just want to start by saying thank you for joining my patreon I'm really happy to have you guys join me in this community and I'm looking forward to working together uh so yeah please don't hesitate to reach out tell me what you guys want to learn if you have any questions about these videos or future videos that you want to see just let me know so jumping in this is a continuation of the nitty midi uh length note length and density trick that I showed in Cubase before only we're going to do it in Ableton so if you haven't watched the other video I recommend jumping in there and seeing that one uh first and then this will make a little bit more sense second thing here is this is going to use some Macs for live devices so if you don't have Ableton version um that includes Max live I recommend you get it there's a ton of amazing uh plugins and and Max live devices that people have made it really expands what Ableton can do so um go ahead and get that but um for the people that don't have them I will include the midi devices that I use here so that you can just drop them into Ableton so first thing got just to match up with the other video I have a virus with uh two oscillators and going routed to the second one and we're using a little bit of FM so easy and again we're not really concerned about the sound here it just need anything to show this trick so then the first thing we're going to do is just like the other one you create your 16th note pattern I have the note lengths here at 30 second notes so we have some empty space in between but they're basically just 16th note pattern and if we listen to it here you'll just hear them evenly repeating every 16th note all right so that's how we start the next part is to use the built-in midi effect from Ableton called note length right here so go ahead and grab that you're going to switch it over to sync mode and then since we have our midi notes at 16th note divisions we will put the length to 16th note now when we play with this gate control we're going to be changing the length of the note so foreign that is the effect that we're going for we're just going to want to automate it so now um we're going to use an LFO I like to use one of the ones from Max for live there's a bunch of different good ones my personal favorite is this one xlfo um where did I put that Max for live plugs here we go sorry guys having a little there we go all right so there's this one called xlfo which I will put in which is really great I like it a lot so the first thing that we're going to do is map this to the gate and now you can see it's going all over the place the next thing we want to do is we're going to want we want to sample and hold type thing so we're going to put this to sync and then make it random now let's just start by putting the rate division at 16th notes so everything's matching up so now we're going to get a new value for each 16th note foreign that's already working pretty great um what we can do though is you know they you can set the first value here and the range here so if we don't want all the way long we can make that we could put the range a little down if we want the first one to have a little bit of length you put it here you also have the depth but that is getting the effect that we want so we'll just leave it like that the next step is also another Max for live plugin which is the density control so we're going to throw that on here as well now this one it works that when it's at zero it's letting all of the notes through when it's at 127 it's letting none of the notes through them so let's go ahead and hear that nothing's coming through all the notes coming through so if we put it somewhere in the middle we're going to get 50 approximately of the notes to be allowed to play and it'll randomly select those so it's going to create a random pattern sometimes plant and it's always going to be changing same thing our gate length is constantly changing so you're going to get a pattern here that is changing in perpetuity uh it won't loop at all um let's see what it sounds like so now let's put it in with the kicking base and we'll see well here we can start a little bit higher just here now let's put in with kicking base and that's what we're going for and then you can play around with the effects of how much you want to get longer shorter notes different density but that is it so basically just to go back from the beginning you need your you", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx":

on and match it up to the length of the notes automate the gate control with a random or sample and hold LFO then add the density control to be able to choose what percentage of the notes you want to

everyone cabayoon here and we are going to do a quick video on a percussion trick that I like to use um this trick what I like to do is you know you have here I'll play you a little sample of the track that I've got going here so we've got our basic percussion rhythms going on and here's the loop so just basic basic percussion Loop but now what we want to do is I want to I want to kind of tease um the percussion at the beginning of the track for our intro and then to have some nice little accents and random kind of hits with a little bit of delay that move around and give a little bit of a you know a moving feel to it and let us introduce the percussion before we come in with our full loop here so if I go back to the beginning we'll hear that I've just put a couple little um I've taken the uh rolling hi-hats and I've muted most of them and just left a few so you can hear that oops ignore that Groove agent for a second [Music] okay so we're starting here with little accents on the percussion on the close hi-hat but now what I want to do is I want to get some snares some Toms some other stuff and just have a little you know stuff like this you know um excuse my vocal terribleness but uh so anyways what we're going to do here is we're going to use a sampler so I'm in Cubase and I'm going to be using the groove agent which is the built-in sampler that comes with it if you guys are using Ableton or anything else there you know you could use battery you could use the sampler drum kits in Ableton you know they have the drum racks so basically anything that has that that's a sampler and so I've just you know I pulled up here um you know for the purposes of this of this video it really doesn't make a difference so I've just pulled up one called vintage kit 3. and if you're here I'll click all these things we have a crash another crash ride two rides Tom another hi-hat Tom crash Tam snare an open snare so that's not with the um and then a close snare here and a cross snake so although that's pretty good um the one thing is is that I am not going to want this kick we don't really want to kick going on even though it's high passed so I'm just going to mute that here and so what we can do is once we get our rhythm going we can just mute any of the ones that we don't like so I'm going to start by muting the kick and then I'm going to show you guys um how we're going to do this so the first thing is if you guys have not already watched my note length and density uh trick please watch that because this is going to be using the same technique um only this time instead of using the midi modifiers to control the um length right we're going to do the random pitch so basically let's open this up I have just created um a one bar Loop where it's just 16th notes all on the same note so if we just go ahead and if I'm going to mute I mean solo this channel so we can just hear it and I'm just going to duplicate this out a few times so that we have uh you know a longer section here so right there it's just playing 16th notes on the same note and what you want to do here is you want to kind of find the range where the notes are so up here there's no hits because we only have one octave down here there's nothing [Music] are our hit so it's about one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten semitones up and one two three four five four down so we could put this anywhere if I wanted I can move it up uh you know a couple so we have like you know eight up and eight down something like that anyways the point is if we go here to our midi modifiers and we activate it then we're going to go to random and in the other ones we wanted length because we wanted to make different note lengths when we were doing a midi line on a synthesizer but here because it's a sampler what I want is I want it to randomly choose to hit some of those different notes um so instead of hitting G every time we would hit that I'm gonna go back to F just so the main one is our something smaller rather than a ride but anyways this is we'll play around with it it's not really important the important thing here is to go to choose pitch so now if we go down four and we go up seven eight ten I think that was what we had 11 or something up there but this will work so now for each note it's going to randomly pick between four semitones down and send 10 semitones up so now", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4393, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name":

the other ones we wanted length because we wanted to make different note lengths when we were doing a midi line on a synthesizer but here because it's a sampler what I want is I want it to randomly choose to hit some of those different notes um so instead of hitting G every time we would hit that I'm gonna go back to F just so the main one is our something smaller rather than a ride but anyways this is we'll play around with it it's not really important the important thing here is to go to choose pitch so now if we go down four and we go up seven eight ten I think that was what we had 11 or something up there but this will work so now for each note it's going to randomly pick between four semitones down and send 10 semitones up so now let's hear this [Music] okay so that is obviously a complete mess but you get the point that it is then on each note it's going to be playing completely different uh sample so that's what we want and now what we want to do is we want to combine that with the density control so let's go ahead and activate the density here and then I'm just going to hit this let's put the density on something now I'll start up at 100 so you can hear it as we move down so let's go down to say like 10 percent there we go so now only each note has a 10 probability of playing and let's just go ahead and loop that go back so now you hear that we're getting random little accents coming through and this is exactly what we're looking for and so now what we can do is if I go to the audio inserts we want to delay now you could do a ping pong stereo multi-tab depends what you want I'm gonna go with the stereo delay here [Music] but just to show you here so we've got um that one half dotted and one quarter dotted and you can hear it and it's moving around so now let's just you know open this up and hear what it sounds like with the kicking base and everything [Music] okay so that's giving you a taste of what we want to do so what I'm going to do here is I'm actually because what we're doing is we're randomly creating these patterns so I'm not choosing which one is hit so some of them are going to be great and some of them are not going to be perfect so what we'll do here is we're just going to go to my bar setting and I'm just going to make this and we're going to just duplicate it a bunch so that we have a longer random part so now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to um we have I just wanted to show you I have a low cut on here just pulling out the low frequencies so you know because we want these as accents I'm just going to put a little lower for recording that way if we need it again we can have a separate one but let's just put it down here around 200 Hertz is fine because again these are going to be accents so even on the snare we don't want the bottom end I'm going to turn off the stereo delay because as I said it's going to randomly choose which hit is going to be you know which which drum will be hit at each um each time so some of them are going to be on some of them won't be exactly perfect and if there's delay then it's going to all mix together so we're going to just record it clean and then we can choose which ones we like and delete the rest and then add the delay after that so I'm just going to go to export here let's choose groov agent and let's say groov agent clean um 24 bits put it into the pool and create an audio track so it just brings it into the project for us okay so that has recorded and as you can see we have some hits so let's go ahead and mute that and now I'm going to put our stereo delay here or you know what we can try um uh let's try the H stereo delay a lot of people like this and let's see how this sounds and we can also put it on ping pong [Music] okay so this is sounding very good this is this is exactly what I'm talking about [Music] okay okay so then what we would do here is we would just find the ones that we don't like you know and then just to show an example maybe I don't want this one or it's not exactly where we want it so I'm just going to make um our waveforms look a little bit bigger so we can see easier so let's say that I so I'm just gonna

gonna get rid of these guys so that then have a little bit less and let's go over here so this one here too um we have this little accent and we probably don't need that for example so let's try that also I don't like that one these are good maybe a little too much here so we'll just mute it let's also put up our [Music] let's just put our uh EQ honest as well so I got a pro Q three is my default so just turn move that and so we keep the high frequencies but we can get a little bit of a roll off so we don't get too much there even if we want we can put a little bit lower here and I'm just going to pull this up because I don't want those Toms um too much [Music] and maybe these guys a little much too [Music] don't want that one you also can move them you know we don't just have to be deleting them [Music] so say maybe this guy here which you see is starting uh kind of on a weird place here um so what we could do is if we just separate these guys out and we could just move this into a different place [Music] so what I'm gonna do actually let's just let's switch these guys [Music] use number two oops and go back to our bar so that we're and I'm just gonna grab this guy and move them here and then this guy that I took over here let's put that on try that so that'll be [Music] [Music] uh so maybe not that one there you don't need too much I mean we're just trying to make a um you know an intro kind of thing and some accents around also we can do this you know if we go back here for example now we've got our delay and everything we can do different versions so now let's go back here let's maybe say make it um you know still low percentage but let's just switch this up we're going high a little bit let's just keep it retracted a little bit so maybe we only go down three and up five so now we're gonna have different hits coming through and we we can then um bounce this so let's do another one one and make a second recording and now let's see what this one looks like so you can see we've got a lot of different hits here and so let's just I'm just to you know duplicate our settings here I'm just going to move this up and then move it down to a new channel that will duplicate the settings on the other one we also could just put it on here and use the lanes but just for our purposes I just want to hear [Music] okay so we're getting a lot of so I think here if we go and I just mute and listen to this we might want to [Music] these crashes are kind of a lot maybe we don't need all these crashes and we'll leave the rise and the snare the actual snare sounds a lot like our other one so we'll leave the ghost we'll leave the snare open and we're gonna get rid of these guys so now I'm gonna open this back up to four and ten and so then now we're going to get all of them but sometimes we'll get you know empty space as well so let's try this again one more recording see what it looks like so clean two all right and now I had already this is the same channel from before with our delay so let's just make sure everything else is muted so we're not hearing it twice we can remove this Channel and let's hear [Music] so now we're not getting all those right I mean there's uh crashes in there as well and then of course you know another thing to be to do", "start_char_idx": 7003, "end_char_idx": 11254, "text_template":

would be to automate um uh this uh delay so that we're not always having you know the same um the same things like if we just I'm just going to do it by hand right now so so that would be foreign [Music] just for an example and we could automate those or you could put them on multiple delays and we could have FX sends here I have a couple different you know delays on the ascends so we could be sending them to different delays whatever you want to do um you know and you can chop out the ones that you don't like and mix them in um different delays add a little Reverb whatever you want to do you can push some backwards but this is a really nice trick that I like to use to just develop just like when we're writing the um you know the synth lines and we want to have the part kind of you know you know bring out the ghost in the machine this is the same thing that we can let the randomness make a pattern for us and we might get some hits where we wouldn't otherwise think to put them and then we can move them around to get them exactly where we want but I really like to use this technique to add those little percussion accents and you could even do this also if you want with just you know with out doing a whole drum kit just a couple different drums and you know say three or four different drums that you want to go around or adjust your Toms or just your rides and a really nice way to create some rhythms with some different hits and you know these little accents so I'll just play it back from the beginning one more time on the second one that we have see what we hear and that'll be it [Music] so we're listening to this one now [Music] so all these ones sounded pretty good maybe you know for example this little one right here doesn't really add much so I would say you know if they're not adding get rid of them or if they're in weird places [Music] this one right on the first hit it's weird and now we'll hear with everything coming in see really nice little accents on top of the parts that are already there so that is it um just to go over it again basically what we're going to do here is create a find a sampler any sampler grab a drum kit or just a few different drum samples of different kinds um and then use your midi modifier and density trick so again we create just 16th notes so that we have every 16th note taken care of and put it somewhere within the range in the octave that the samples are and then go over to the midi modifiers and this time we'll be using the pitch set the Min and the max to the somewhere within the range of where the samples are and then put your density and put the density very low you know around 10 percent or lower maybe up to 15 depending on how many you want um so you don't get too many overlaps and then record then when you get into the audio uh you know delete any ones that are out of place move some edit it a little bit to get it exactly the way you want add your delay EQ Reverb and you're good to go so thanks a lot guys this was um cabion here teaching a percussion random midi modifier trick and I hope you guys enjoyed stay tuned for the next video thanks have a good day guys",

live set is there's no right or wrong way to do it and a lot of people you'll hear some criticism from I don't know people who I think don't actually make the music or aren't DJs criticize people for say not doing enough people who like play a push play Live set well that can be a little bit boring there are reasons for it and um you know you could break down your live set and have you know a million different um you know control over everything but ultimately you know music is experiential so no matter what you put into it and you're doing in the DJ booth what ultimately matters is you know what's coming out the other side what what the people are experiencing and they actually can't see what you're doing most of the time you know so if you're sitting there fiddling with a thousand things and you've got this thing you know amazing set where you can do everything you want but it doesn't sound great then what's the point and somebody who might just be playing their finished tracks you know with uh like tractor or something like okay so they're not very doing very much it's not really a live set but you know if it sounds good that's what's important and also I think that just to say that you know producers didn't choose the term live um you know I was a lot of times say it could be called a producer set but anyways it's the organizers who decide what it's called um and there's a big range to do it and there's no right way but basically I'll show you that I have mine in two setups so I have basically tracks and all my tracks that have written color code them a little bit and I put them into two channels so it depends on how like what the setup is at the CL at the place that you're playing because one thing I always do is I put a I'll record a version of the set that's close to what I think I'm going to play um or planned out you know plan out something like this and I'll show you this side in a second um but and then I'll put that onto a onto a flash drive and I'll put that in one of the cdjs just in case you never know if your computer is going to die and it's nice that you can just put the backup on luckily I haven't had to do that but I know friends who have and it's really a disaster if in the middle of your set your computer dies and you know you don't have a backup so I always have one channel for a backup now it depends so usually you have a four channel mixer if there's two artists playing then that other artist is going to need one channel so but some places that you'll play each artist will have their own mixer you know it's some big festivals and so in that case if I have the whole mixer to myself then I'll do it the you know the way that I prefer to do it which would be that I have channel one here and I would be going to my external out and I would go out one channel and then I have my next Channel going out to another channel on the mixer and then I would have my tracks mastered and I would have the cue points I mean sorry not mastered but I would have them um warped um and I have um yeah so I would warp them and I have a free video I can show you guys how to do that it's on my Vimeo um but so I wore the tracks and then I would just cue them and then I would use the actual mixer you know to mix them in just like if you were playing them off cdjs um and ultimately that will give you the best sound and then I'll have a if I so if I have all four channels then I have two Channels with tracks and then I'll be routing um all this other stuff if you can see here whatever I have so I have if I'm using my modular I have a clock modular and has the midi then I would have my audio in which would be coming back in to and then I have now bino channel here different albino one serum and here you can see I am using some different midi modifiers like that delay EQ the xlfo which is going to the gate time and my density and I like this when I'm playing live because I can keep the density on a knob and it's all the way up so no sounds are coming through and then if I want to just let a couple Bops whatever you know some sounds from the serum um I can just do that and then I can also switch between sounds just switch the patch and the whole setup is the same so I'll do that and then all of these sounds that I'm using I route into a group Channel and then I would send that group to um the third the third output so now I have all my extra sounds being mixed through one channel", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4528, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

channel here different albino one serum and here you can see I am using some different midi modifiers like that delay EQ the xlfo which is going to the gate time and my density and I like this when I'm playing live because I can keep the density on a knob and it's all the way up so no sounds are coming through and then if I want to just let a couple Bops whatever you know some sounds from the serum um I can just do that and then I can also switch between sounds just switch the patch and the whole setup is the same so I'll do that and then all of these sounds that I'm using I route into a group Channel and then I would send that group to um the third the third output so now I have all my extra sounds being mixed through one channel and uh that way you know and so then here what you can also see is I've just set up you know if I'm using short notes like this for the midi note length trick then I just have H key and so since they're in the group I could just click the group here and everything's in key so as I'm switching keys I'll just switch the uh um which want them here and then everything is in the same key and depending if they're a long note short note whatever it is um so I can just keep them in key I have some vocal samples of random stuff here from shows and things that you would want to put in and those will go through that and then if I was using as I said any external stuff they would be over here all going through the same group and I like to do this too because that way you can have the fader if something's going wrong or something sounds too loud you just move it down on the fader okay so that would how I would do it if I have the entire um mixer available but in a lot of cases maybe one channel is broken you're on there with another person you can't use the entire mixer and so then there would be two options one you could DJ you can have the two channels out and then I would be changing this each time I switched and my main channel was going out say channel one I could switch to um sending my extra sounds to the other channel and this works but it's a little bit going back and forth also it depends on what kind of set I'm going to play if I'm playing an hour long and all the tracks are going to be kind of in the same um the same like Vibe right I'm gonna be playing more of the Twilight set or more of a darker Forest set then it's easier for me I find to just mix my tracks um you know like this playing them and using the clips to go but sometimes I like to St you know do something where I go from you know a slower let's see here I have some if we go to the master and uh show me the automation you know I have some I like to also play the tracks at their individual thing but sometimes I'll go you know I'll start out 148 sometimes if I play like two hours or something I'll start quiet I mean I'll start lower speed and then go up and so if I'm doing that attack move um if I'm doing that then a lot of times it depends you know my tracks sometimes are very different and it can be really difficult for me on the fly to mix one track with the other also sometimes I have you know two or three two tracks that I really like to play together in sequence so this allows me to do that and so if I have and also if I only had two channels available this is what I would do because I still for me I'd rather not be just DJing two tracks one to the other I get a little bored with that and I like to you know add extra sounds on top so if I'm faced with just having two channels available instead of having two channels mixing what I will do is I will arrange my set and so what I'll do is I'll put the tracks here and I'll choose where I want to play them and so what you can see if this looks a little weird why some people you see have like the latter thing where each check is on a different Channel what I've done here is I have two the two channels that I showed you before are just the tracks and they don't have any eqs or anything on them they're completely clean then I have a channel that has a high pass on to it right so what I'll do is instead of automating filters and frequencies on when I want to make the mix right so if I'm introducing the part of let's listen here ah sorry guys I can go quieter so [Applause] God damn it sorry guys get really sorry about that", "start_char_idx": 3621,

right so if I'm introducing the part of let's listen here ah sorry guys I can go quieter so [Applause] God damn it sorry guys get really sorry about that so I put just I just grabbed the clip where I want it at the crossover so I would like if I take this I would warp my track put it in grab this piece and shoot it up to the high pass one so then instead of having automations going back and forth and having to change things then I just put this so this is being high passed or this is being high passed and then these parts are 100 clean and I switch them on the trans silver now the reason I also like this is that I can very easily change things on the Fly say I decide that I don't want to play this track after this I can just move segments around right I could grab this if I just like grab this the top here right I could grab this whole section and no come on and I could move it and then if I want to change things right I also it's very easy because I can just add another track at the end here say I wanted to keep going you know I could just take the part that I wanted to mix in I'd be like all right I'm going to mix it here so I put that there and then I just add the next track and keep going so it allows you to rearrange things if I was using eqs and stuff on each of these tracks and I had automation I would have to change that automation every time so if I'm going to do a pre-arrange set I like to do it this way because that allows me the maximum flexibility to change things as I'm going so I still could have a pre-arranged set but I still can change things as I'm if I'm playing here I can be doing things over here changing stuff around and just letting it play through so I can still actually or you could even I could do it on the fly but I'm setting things up and the reason that I like to do it this way especially if I as I said if I only have two channels because then I'll have so these one all three of these go to the master and then the group or so the channel one on the mixer and the other group of my extra sounds goes to the second channel so then I have my mix playing out one channel and then I still have the freedom to use the faders and the eqs to add in my extra sounds because it's really nice when you're playing a sound to kind of you know put the fader up a little bit and put it down also to be able to use the effects in the uh mixer you know to you know do stuff on your sounds so this would be the way that I do it if I only have two channels available um and I want to you know I'm playing a set where I want to start somewhere and go somewhere but again it's not necessarily going to be exactly this because since I'm doing it this way like for example say I just wanted to change these two tracks right so what I would just want to do is make sure that at the beginning they're lined up where they at the break points and I'm going to easily switch these two so now which ones I was doing these two so what I can do is I have an extra channel here also this one that says tracks boost all you leave in case I'm doing my own masters or something and there's a track that needs to be volume you know controlled the volume on its own so what I can do is just switch these guys just put this one here so now put this here so you know the set could be playing while I'm doing this and then take these parts and switch them so this is going to be the intro to the next oops grab the whole thing so this one is now the intro to this and this is the intro to this so I just move that over put it in its spot you just got to zoom in to your right breaking points so put that in there um and then again go to here to where the point is this one then you just got", "start_char_idx": 7222, "end_char_idx": 11681, "text_template":

oh and I I have to change the one other thing so I go like this and then this one is then the other thing here is now I have to change this this is the escape Velocity and and this is this one so I put that there and I put this here and now I've just flipped the order of those tracks and it took me two minutes to do less than that you know so I could be doing this on the Fly also when I'm traveling a lot and I'm playing every single night this way it allows me to quickly move things around and then again also sometimes I like to keep two or three tracks together and so then I could just grab the little chunk like that and move them around so it's almost like a modular setup where I can just move the pieces around in my set and it allows me flexibility but also the reason I like to do this too is because sometimes I really like to beat when I'm adding sounds and stuff I don't want to add extra channels and extra sounds into the you know um the uh like the peak of the track where everything's happening you know I'm gonna be adding The Sounds where there's you know in a dead part like you know where there's like a clean like I might be adding some things here [Applause] and or at the transition points and it can be really annoying when you're like jamming out playing some sweet lead and then you're like oh crap I missed the you know cue Point by you know one bar or something and you can fix it in Ableton but I do feel that sometimes when I'm doing it in this mode that I'm spending a lot more of my time counting finding the things which is essentially what a DJ is doing but I feel that um you know sometimes it can be nice instead of doing that to you if you arrange it so even though I'm still choosing the tracks but then I'm putting it where I want so I don't have to sit there and go three four five click it you know and just let it play and I can be um uh yeah uh so I can you can disable the studies bar which is a good idea uh I forget how to do that but yeah you can disable the start stop on the space bar because yeah sure it's really you got to be careful um about that especially if sometimes when I'm doing things I'm pressing the command button which is right next to the space bar and yeah so that's the worst but yeah so I I usually disable and you don't need it when you're starting you know you can just um click the top the play button and then you know if I'm using my backup what I'll be doing is I'll be I'll hit play you know touch my mouse at the same time as I hit play on this on the uh on the CD player so that they're both in tune I mean or in in time um but yeah so generally I'll be honest that I if I have the whole mixer I'll like to do it this way because then I can have two channels to mix with the um with the individual channels and you because there's nothing better than being able to pull out the bass and stuff like that on the actual mixer the one problem here is if you see in Ableton they have what looks nope not that one they have what looks to be you know a basic EQ that would work like uh on your EQ your DJ mixers but you'll hear if we if we play Anywhere hello um if we play Anywhere first of all look let's it's look what it's doing to the sound there so it's not clean it's not clear it's not transparent you would you know and I wish somebody would just like emulate the uh um Pioneer you

perfectly people do it there are ways that you can make there are some people who have made Max for life and and you uh or instrument racks that do it similarly using the eq8 to make your own which will sound better it's a little bit complicated to set up but don't use the eq3 even though it seems good because you could use it you know make your own knobs on your own controller but it's going to color the sound and it sounds like crap so don't use that so that's the problem with Ableton is that you know if I want to use something like this then I want to use the actual DJ mixer so if I have all four channels I'll mix on the DJ mixer if I only have two then I'll do an arrange set like this and just jam out on top and let the Transitions and stuff happen and then you know mix breaks mix things and again if I decide to make changes I still have the flexibility to move the tracks around I just don't have to actually hit you know play on the on the on the track to get it to go um so then I can be free to do other stuff but again this is just my way of doing it there's tons of other ways to do it um you know the good thing also about this though is that in if I don't make any changes from my original plan then also I have my backup recording will be exactly what I'm playing um if I'm doing it on the fly my backup is usually close to what I'm playing but not exact good enough you know I've never had to use it so it's okay um but anyways that's uh this is what I do and um yeah and it allows me the freedom to jam out on top of the set and you know I generally have

and color coding and some things like that um so this is something that is really important to me um I find that it's a lot easier to work when you're organized um and whether it's a solo track a collaboration uh whether you're just starting or you have a project you already have made that's becoming a little bit hard to you know see what's going on see where you're at and you can apply these techniques um to to organize things a bit so let me just go ahead and jump in here and show you the way that I organize my tracks and I'll even I even have a Cubase template project with these folders already set up so that as I start I can just um you know I already have the folders made but you can also do it each time differently if there's no set of rules so the first thing that I do is in Cubase you can create here folder tracks now this folder track then you can name here so if I wanted to make a new one let's just say I said uh you know fills or something it would make a new folder here and then I can put the tracks into that so if I make an audio track inside it now and then oops you drop that let's get out of that cancel you drop this into the fills folder and so now it's underneath it so you just basically can Nest them now in Cubase these folders are not actually um they don't have any routing so you can't do any automation on it if you want to create a like a bus track you have to do that separately so let me show you how I do that then with my kick base for example so I create a folder track for my kick and my bass and here I have uh the kick which is an audio I have my base which I've now at because it's the end of the I finished this track is uh rendered out to audio here I have the midi which is now soloed um so these are in a folder here which I can solo and unsolo but they're not actually routed together so I also have a group track here that is the kick and bass and so for an individual uh track here in Cubase it would be routed to the kick bass bus now in something like Ableton Live uh the when you group a track it'll put it into the folder as well as uh making it on a group channel so you have kind of both of them in one in Cubase it's kind of a separate thing and so here I'm just using the folders for organization so you can see I have my kick base here I also this is my percussion folder so if I just pop that out you'll see that we have our percussion here and then see this is the great thing you can really collapse like I have my whole project and we can see the whole thing here and then if I pop out my leads now you know we have leads and FX channels are all here and then what I do is I also uh have another folder where I put well I just call it instruments and this is where I have all of the things that I'm actually working on that are that are um you know for recording in and I'll show you um I have one which is set up with my virus TI I have a record uh one for recording live takes from the virus for example here I have serum and this um you know just render in place into the audio and then I have my midi which I'm sending out to my modular and to my other external synths and then I have my audio in which is taking from um the I have a Mackie multi multi-channel mixer and so I run that into my um my audio card um which is the Apollo twin um so that I just have two so I have two inputs there so I route everything into the mixer and then into here so yeah basically I have my this is what I use to create all the sounds and so for example you'll see here uh this is the sound I ended up not going with but you know I had recorded here something from um the Novation Peak so say I was going to use this sound here um I'll just remember which one it is but if it was unmuted here so what I would do is after I I put this here I put whatever things on to it I was going to I have a Fab filter and a ping pong delay and then I was ready for it and I said all right I'm finished with this I'm going to go on to making the next sound and then I would just drag it up here and so if I pop it I would just drag it into the leads in FX and so that now this channel became right here it goes down to the bottom and so now this is part of the folder so I would close my instruments and keep going now this is another thing that I find really important you'll see here that my track is", "start_char_idx": 0,

to the bottom and so now this is part of the folder so I would close my instruments and keep going now this is another thing that I find really important you'll see here that my track is laid out like a staircase walking down from left to right and this so the way that I find this is also very important because at the end of the project when I'm going to be mixing things together say I wanted to mix this part right here where this um sound I just put is so say I'm listening to the track and I have I'm I'm you know watching over um on the mixer and I'm looking at things you know there's a few parts all playing together at the same time here now if these part these tracks if like this track 10 here was up here and this sound was down here and also we're looking at things kind of bigger right I might be working in this area on these sounds and I would just be seeing what's going on here so I have some other things that are happening that are out of the screen so what I would do here to just make this problem go or not to have this problem is I would just move all of these things next to each other like this so I would move all the channels where all the sounds are into the same area to kind to create uh which which then when you zoom out is what gives you this kind of staircase feel and then you know that all of the parts that you're dealing with are right there on top of each other so for example if you're trying to do something like let's see where this uh here we go these sounds you can see that this sound and then this one is here this one you can see them in relation to each other and I ended up not putting this sound because it actually ends up overlapping with a lot of the sounds that are already there so I got rid of this one and then again because I don't want to be confused by things I pulled it out I left it down here to see maybe I'll use that later maybe it would be somewhere else but I just threw it back into the instruments folder so that it's in there with things that I haven't decided on yet and I might pull in so by organizing it like this it's going to really allows so right now if I was listening through to this track I could just be soloing I could solo only these channels that are playing right here very easily and I would be able to then using an equalizer looking at all of the channels on the stereo or just individual ones with fabfilter Pro Q anything like that you can sometimes see the other channels but you just have it this makes the end a lot easier because all of the sounds that you have are they're happening sonically in the same place and you want to put them visually in the same place so that you're able to easily find everything and you're not searching through oh where's that sound where's I can't figure out where that little bleep sound is you know because you put them visually all together so we've talked about oh the next thing is color coding now the colors that you do don't matter at all um you can make your own custom color sets I personally like them to just be as different as possible so I can really see it quickly but uh you know I usually do my percussion as yellow my atmospheres is one of these green things my leads and effects I like blue because it's a neutral kind of looking color to me so it has uh with the contrast on my screen it's easy on the eyes and I'll keep everything color coded I have one thing here that you'll see is yellow this is I just wanted a different color because this is the vocal sample and I want to be able to just locate that very quickly um and the kick and bass I have red and green again the actual colors don't matter the point is is that it's color coded so that you can just easily see things uh where they are you'll see here also I have a couple pounds that are red this is another thing I like to do is if you use everything in a single color then I'm going through and I", "start_char_idx": 3563, "end_char_idx": 8164,

in a single color then I'm going through and I hear you know what this sounds something's not quite right about it so what I'll do then is change the color of that one to just be red so if I thought that this part here was needed a little work but you know I'm on something else I'm working on something else just make it red which means you know what come back to that and fix it do something later and then as I go through I'll you know when I fix that I would just then turn it back to the neutral color and I would know that I had taken care of whatever issue I had heard before you can also write yourself notes but sometimes you don't have a piece of paper around or you don't want to switch over and write it down you just give that visual trigger to remember to yourself you've got to do something to that part before you come back to it then another thing about organization that I suggest is um to use for some of the preset the plugins that you use all the time like if you look here you'll see that I have Fab filter on the fabfilter pro Q3 on nearly every channel some of these have already been rendered out and they probably had it already but so what I I don't want to have to put a high pass and a low pass on every single time that I open it up so for example just if I I'm gonna get rid of this one here and so say I was working on this sound that I just looked at before now I want to put the pro Q on it I just type my guy in here and it's already got settings on this and I've already just set you know uh high pass and a shelf and another shelf and then the low pass because this is a good starting point because very easily I can just be like if I only want high pass and low pass I've just got that here if I want to have a little bit of shells which sometimes can be not very useful I've got that and then the first click I have is going to be a bell you know there are Bells here so this way I don't have to kind of dig through and it can be already and it just saves a ton of time because you're always going to be adding the high pass you're always going to be adding the low pass you might as well set that up I also have a few others like my ping pong delay here just a built-in one I set it up a little bit with the high and the low filters on it and a little bit change just because that way I don't have to dial in some of these things every single time I do them and every program is different the way that you do that but it's pretty simple like for example in Cubase you just set uh the default preset here and so in Ableton and other things they have that as well but default presets is a great way to save yourself some time while working so that's basically everything I know is a little bit rambling but I'll just go back through at the beginning uh or from the from the top so organize make folders uh for your tracks and then color code those so that you can easily see different sounds that are in different things and you can make your own different ones if you want this will also help later if you were to you know do stems because then I have my four stems here atmospheres leads and effects perk and kick and bass and you could just also mimic those with a group Channel or an actual bus if you need to but organizationally organize them like that make the staircase so that you can see all of the parts you are and that's just by moving the you know when moving the parts around vertically to line up where they would be so that you can see all the things at the same time uh and then set um use default presets and that's basically it so thank you guys very much um this is something again there are no rules on this this is just the kind of the way that I do it", "start_char_idx": 7233, "end_char_idx": 11831,

something again there are no rules on this this is just the kind of the way that I do it I just wanted to give you a little example but organizing well if you have a track already written out go ahead do this first right go right into it now the next time you open up some project that's all over the place put your things into uh groups color code them make the staircase and you will see how much easier it is to do the final mixing steps especially if you have over 100 channels I mean it can be really complicated if you have things all over the place so go ahead and do that then also you know the next time you start a new track a new channel uh yeah a new project um set it up right from the beginning just make the basic groups add the color codes and then save that as a d as a default project also in Cubase you can do the same thing save as template so I could save just these groups without actually any channels filling them um and so then right when I start out I've got my color codes and I'm ready to go and I think you'll find that this helps you to work bit faster especially and at the end when you're doing the mixing stages but basically all the way through so thanks guys I'm gonna jump in with another video in a few minutes on virus TI but I just wanted to do this subject which is near and dear to my heart color coding and organization so thanks make some comments if

virus TI which is uh classic synthesizer it's one of my favorites it's really a Workhorse I think inside trans production um and it's the great thing about it is that it uh comes with it's a hardware synthesizer but the ti means total integration and so it has a VST that you can use to program it and control everything um and so this really makes it a breeze to make some complicated patches different kinds of routing um and that's why it's really a go-to synth for a lot of people uh so anyways let's jump right into it if I'm going to be going through a ton of stuff probably in this one um and so if you have any questions just note it down um put in the comments and I can uh Circle back to them in another video to answer people's questions or we can just discuss on the patreon site all right so the first thing I'm going to do here is I'm going to pull up an initial patch so I'm going to go to the just Ram a and then here at the end we have the initial patch so at the start I'm just going to be triggering it by playing notes on my keyboard um before we get into programming the MIDI so the first thing that we got here just to give a quick layout for those of you who haven't seen it for those who have just bear with me we have the oscillator section here one oscillator two oscillators this is stuff influencing how they work together which we'll go into oscillator three here you have noise Unison this is the mixer where you can go in between them we have our filters here um our envelopes this is the filter one this is the amplitude amplifier envelope and then you have other ones as well we have our lfos here The Matrix section for more complicated routing arpeggiator page here FX1 which is chorus phasor Distortion this kind of thing and then delay and Reverb and vocoder which um yeah these ones are on the last page then you have some other things here if you want to um transpose the whole thing change your outputs this is where you set whether you're going to be using the virus as a using the USB connection like I have it here or taking the actual outputs um you know like the TRS cables out also you have soft knobs and if you have a virus um TI snow then these will be really useful because you can control uh you can set any of these parameters to these knobs which is really useful all right so now that we've just gone over the quick thing we'll jump into it and you'll see how I use some of these things the first thing to just go over is so it starts out here in this classic mode in the in the oscillators we have a bunch of different ones I'm going to start out and the first sound I'm just going to go through to give a little walk through is like a uh saw a high pass saw which is a very kind of common sound for scitrans so the first thing I'm going to do here is I just want to see one oscillator and it doesn't matter which one we can go over and use this one oscillator too so by putting the balance here we're only going to be getting the second oscillator so if I play you hear it's just a straight saw now for this typical high pass saw sound um basically it's just a as I said in high pass with some nice bit good resonance on this and right here just to show it for the beginning we're going to go the filter balance so I just want the filter just one filter now what we're going to do is we're going to automate or I mean or just play do some sweeps of the filter very nice and I mean as you get already here this is like the sound now if we go and I've played different octaves you can hear if I play one octave lower you get this and if I go even lower see you're gonna get the diff the um frequency of the wave if it gets lower since it's a saw you're really going to hear those separate out and as you get higher they're going to go together so if we just do each octave [Music] so we probably want in here somewhere these octaves and then also you can do a band pass with these as well and then for this typical sound basically what we want is with some Reverb and I'm going to put some put the feedback up gonna use just even a ping pong just to see what happens and so now let's go back to the filter sweeps let's go to high pass so we can hear it and yeah let's get some sound in here [Music] put a little Reverb on here as well get a little more of the volume on the delay now you hear that we hear the low sound over here because I haven't put any uh EQ on", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4502, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

if we go and then we'll want we have this I have it it's not just the basic high pass here [Music] and if we move this up a little bit more then maybe we won't get as much of the salon well let's not use this one actually we're gonna go instead I'm gonna just put on a uh Pro Q3 and just get rid of these other guys that I have and we're just gonna keep our high pass fine so now [Music] [Applause] great so uh also just so you guys know that these while we're talking about the virus TI here these techniques can work with everything so now this is the basic one um basic sound like this we just have a saw and you have um uh the high pass now other things you could do with this would be putting in lfos to the pitch um and that will kind of get you a different sound which I'm going to go into in another video so I'm not going to get into that here um but this is the very one of the you know the simplest type of patch you could have one oscillator with the uh going through one filter and not even using any modulation or anything like that and just using your hands uh to sweep this through now if you and and obviously you can use this I can I'm touching the actual um knobs on the real synthia and um just to go over the so we remember we have the uh envelopes down here so if you want to play with those on your sound as well but so that is basic high pass saw now what we're going to do is we're going to go into take the next step um with making another type of psytrance sound which is going to be instead of using one saw wave we're going to be putting these FM together so since we have um the we're taking the second one if we put the FM amount it's going to be this one going through this one and so we get we want the second because that's the multiplying so FM stands for frequency um modulation and basically uh if you take two different waves and you multiply them together then you get more complicated waves forms so basically that's what this is doing here and we'll be able to hear what happens if I start putting the FM oh so first I'm just going to take my uh filter make sure it's down here so we have our normal note I'm also going to turn off the effects so we're back to just simple sound so then we go back to oscillator so now the first thing we're going to do is just start moving this FM knob here [Music] so now if we're looking at an oscilloscope you would really be seeing how these waves are going from simple saw to overlapping multiplying and forming more complicated um uh waves waveforms now there are a couple different types here positive triangle which is going to be a triangle just up and this is all about how the way that they're going to be multiplying together and so you know just the great you can just try the different versions and see what you like sometimes triangle can be better than positive triangle waves going to be so let's do the normal triangle for now okay now one thing if you listen to it you're going to hear a little bit and maybe if we pull up our uh equalizer here just to see it's going to be moving a bit this go it's going to be um phasing in and out and you'll hear just a subtle change to it and if you watch here you can see this is phasing so the way that that's because these oscillators are not synced to each other so if we sync one to two this is going to make sure that that doesn't happen [Music] so as you can see it's still moving a little bit because that's what happens with FM but it's staying except now if we take this off again all over the place so for our type of",

our type of stuff if you want it to track really well which means across different notes um and and sounding the same and not getting out of tune then you're going to want the sync on so [Music] obviously for anybody who's listening to psytrance this is getting a good sound now what you can do here is play with there's lots of different to show you the different waveforms here we can we're just in the classic mode so if you spin this dial you get different shapes from saw here to sine wave here and then when you're in a sign here you can also then choose it has lots of other different waves in this classic form um there are also wave tables and other things in different modes we'll get to later but so if we put them both to a sign you're going to get this kind of now one thing we can also do is to get a little bit more difference between them is by putting one of these octaves down and go up one octave so I can just a little more also if we go up with this one we're going to get the further apart they are the bigger uh the more the FM is going to work see now this would be about where this is if the FM is all the way up see now if we go to about halfway FM but we put this up more so um so and if you hear the difference again cyan first saw so you're going to get different effects with these and it's great to mix them in in a track um so now what we're going to do is we're going to start applying some modulation to this so first thing I'll just go back to design just to hear it for a second um no reason in particular and what we're going to do here is the first thing I want to do is I want to just kind of modulate this FM amount so if we go here to the lfos we have multiple lfos that have their built-in routings that you can take advantage of you can also route them here with this one or you can go into the Matrix select them and then route them again this way is great because it's it's not just positive direction it's also it's you can go in both so you can invert it excuse me so the net the type I'm going to make right now is I want to get some sample and hold modulation going on which obviously if anybody knows my music this is you know my favorite thing to do so the first thing we're going to do here is we're going to um we can try putting to SNH now since let's put it to say a clock of 1 8th note and let's see what happens oh sorry we have to Route it to something so I'm going to Route it to let's just say because I haven't even put a filter on done anything yet let's just go or I haven't used it I want to modulate this FM amount so we can just use this one here but actually I'm going to put it in the Matrix I prefer to use the Matrix so we're going to choose LFO want and we can choose bipolar or unipolar I'm going to choose bipolar and then we're going to do oscillator 2 FM amount put it up so to move around now if we put it to a 16th note okay great so some of you guys have seen my uh well no wait first next thing I want to show you is so let's go ahead and put that back on the eighth notes just to not be going too crazy for a minute and so we have the um oh yes we have no no before I go to that I'm going to just go into a different way so first of all we have this is putting sample in hold based onto a Time division so if I hold it down we're gonna get these movements this is great if you want that kind of motion but uh as you guys have seen in the other videos what", "start_char_idx": 7174, "end_char_idx": 11495, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

division so if I hold it down we're gonna get these movements this is great if you want that kind of motion but uh as you guys have seen in the other videos what we were talking about in the pigments and Serum is having a um a random that is for each note not for a Time division that way um for each separate note you get a different value regardless of and then it'll change on the next note rather than in the middle of the note if that note is say longer than one eighth note if like we have here so in um the virus TI this is just this one random so now if I hold it it's not going to change when I play the keyboard but every time I play a key it's going to change so this is this is just exactly what we want and so to get um you know like something moving here let's go ahead and let's add if let's put a filter let's go to a band pass actually let's just go to a low pass for a second with a little bit of higher resonance and now what I'm going to do is um also put the same one random to the filter one cut off we can inverse them so so that's pretty nice and now if we wanted to do the uh you know my median and note length trick we have this is an F sharp we have our notes throw them in then put our mini modifiers on so now we're getting a new filter cut off and FM amount for every note now we can use our density foreign so let's go ahead and also because we already have it we could just um let's just use the same one just for the purpose of this and just give a tiny bit [Music] foreign [Applause] so basically what we've done here is just the fm2 oscillator FM amount the filter cut off and the amplitude sorry the amp envelope release so this is a super simple path and you can always say it's on super psyched dog you can play with density now people often ask about how I like to do things now one thing I might do on here is when I wanted to record this I might then take the delay off and um then play around here with the density get the one I like and then I have my virus going to in Cubase you need to put it to a bus channel so I have it to a record bus and so the output of this is going to the record and then I have a recording Channel that I take the input from that bus so if I wanted to record something in here I just arm this track and just hit record foreign so I have now just put it to audio and the reason that I like to do this sometimes dry is because now like let's just see here if we wanted to just Loop this part [Music] so now I'll put a EQ here and then just what was it I had a ping pong delay something I think it was on the eighth something like that so it's a little too many of them I think at that moment so uh the reason that I like to do this by putting the delay after is because it's just easier to remove notes when you don't have delayed Tails going through everything so let's just say let's break this down and I'm gonna chop this guy up by Beats for now and let's see so we don't need [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] adjusting the SE so now I'm going to get into too much going on here just that I wanted to show you that the sometimes I'll take the things off to then do this kind of editing I mean go way more in detail in here we can fix a lot of things you just have a bit of Freedom if you bounce the somewhat clean without delay without Reverb and then you can do a lot more chopping and stuff because if you do the Reverb in the delay first sometimes it's just too wet and you really can't cut and slice in the same way and you can always add the Reverb And Delay later so all right that was the side

timed ones because we're getting random notes coming in and so we can't predict where they're going to be and we don't know what the time divisions of them are going to be so we want to go with the note on rather than the sample and hold beat quantized so now the next thing I want to show you is how to use the arpeggiator from um the virus which also allows you to do things so I'm going to move this guy I'm going to get rid of it over here and now I'm just going to I'm going to turn off my midi modifiers and my midi inserts so that every time I hit the note we get our sound so we are still now triggering every time I hit the note we're going to get a different value here's something a little different while we do this what if we uh if you want to hear the difference let's put it to our saw [Music] also nice then also here if we want to we can choose other kinds of waves and there's tons but let's just go straight for the moment so now what we're going to do is we're going to turn on the arpeggiator so there's different modes that are going to depend on the different notes played I'm not actually going to be playing chords right now so we can just put it um we can hit random doesn't make difference if it was up or not because we're not going to be playing chords and I'm not going to be playing different notes um but these would go if you have if you're playing you know like uh C and A G then up would go up down would go down from them up and down go up down as played random you get it so first thing here is if we choose random and then there are a bunch of um uh patterns already built in so let's hear one cool now I'm just gonna I'm just modulating with my hand here the release time nice uh you also I'll a lot of times when I'm playing with um these types of patterns I like to put the note length one to this um so then I can control this on the on the actual device as well on the hardware so uh back to the arpeggiator so there's a lot of cool different patterns built in here and you have the note length you have the swing hold just play it once and it'll keep playing so I might as well turn that on different battles [Music] [Music] so cool I don't know why I'm saying cool so much but anyways uh the next thing that I want to show you is what is actually my favorite made to use this if you go to User it's going to start out and it's just going to be a very basic 16 note um pattern but what you can do here and you can you choose the resolution of this here and so I have it on 16th notes and we put the note length up a little bit now what you can do is these buttons randomize it so we can randomize the steps then we can randomize the length much better there's much more what we want and then here we can also randomize the velocity foreign type of modulation so instead of using random which will have a rant which is working with the this so each note here in the arpeggiator counts as a discrete note so we're getting a random uh value for each of these just like we did with our midi trick the only difference is is that this is going to repeat after 32 it's not going to be perpetually changing like using the midi modifiers is going to be but one thing that's cool about this is if we instead of using say random and we go", "start_char_idx": 14091, "end_char_idx": 18450, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

modifiers is going to be but one thing that's cool about this is if we instead of using say random and we go to Velocity on the amount here is going to be so the velocity level is going to be the trigger so if we now play this you'll hear something quite different [Music] thank you and as you can see it's repeating and so here if we get a high value that's why we're getting now this High um envelope the release is too much so if we put this down so now low we just don't want to get so much variety there [Music] and see the thing here is now if we just hit this and we randomize it we'll get different patterns thank you so what I like to do is do a mix of some of these I would rather keep the filter on the random and also this the envelope release but maybe we can put do the velocity to make a pattern coming out that we repeat of our uh um FM amount so as you can see this is another way to and and then obviously you know I'm just hitting random here because this is what I'm trying to show you but we can you know you can do whatever you want you can get rid of these nodes and make them into ties you can make them uh you can change the length you can do everything you want in here you can make the pattern shorter if we wanted just one bar to repeat and the cool thing one thing I like about this is then you can just play a couple notes when you're and if we put a little let's get our delay going back okay so then [Music] so I'm just playing a couple different notes Here and then I'm taking my fingers off so this is nice because then you connect the clay but you have it a little bit you can choose where you want to play them but you know you're making a long note and you're getting lots of little short notes [Music] okay so let me check my notes here um okay great so basically now we've shown I've shown you the random the velocity on and then of course we have our just basic uh if we were to go um the sample and hold obviously there are tons of other kinds of um uh things here like if we wanted to just modulate instead of let's say let's try putting this triangle here and instead of having um and let's go let's put clock on say every two bars gonna go up and down and we're going to put this one onto the and so instead of velocity on let's do the oscillator amount here um going with the LFO so it's going to be lfo2 I can't really hear much difference but it's it's there um anyways so the next thing that um I want to go into is um because obviously just play around with all these different things there's a million um different shapes and everything you can use um the next thing I wanted to show is that in here if so if we have our sound we also have some very nice um Distortion and other kinds effects so let's just play this go back in thank you [Music] we have different Distortion modes [Music] some of these are going to change the sound a lot so you can play with all these lots of different variety in here we have phasers different amounts of stages we also have the EQ here this is pretty useful you can set the frequency and it's showing you down here where the frequency is oops and so there's the gain the frequency and so if we want to give ourselves a little more a lot of times you want to put the lows down a bit and then give yourselves some highs and mids we also have filter bank here which you can do valve filter comb filters so you can get really crazy effects for different types of sounds [Applause] okay so we also this this is basically a we are using an FM patch here and so now I just want to show you a couple things that

waveforms so here I'm going to turn the arpeggiator off we just hear our notes also going to just pull these things down to the middle so we okay so to hear the different sounds we have lots of different waveforms so there's tons of different waveforms and so you could really get a lot of variety in these sounds and again as I said if you put different amounts you can really get different types of sounds and you don't have to stay I'm going 12 semitones up and down but you can also go in between those uh and really play around with different um sounds okay so now I want to show you this also wave table here and there's lots of different wave tables and then here what happens is just to show you if I so now we're just going to hear one you can scroll through the waveforms like this so these are going to give you crazy if you're using them as fans um there are also then we have different there's wave pulse width modulation so you can modulate the pulse width here there's grain and formant so I want to try playing with this formant for a second so we've got um again there's all these different waveforms in here and then there's these things the F shift form it shift and form it spread so what we're going to do is put this spread up a bit actually here um I'm gonna put the FM amount out and let's do this one there's no just want to go over here okay so let me just here different ones foreign [Music] to this and so instead of having the uh I'm going to go back to the random here since we're not using the velocity at the moment uh the arpeggiator and um we're going to put this to that so let's go oscillator one F shift [Music] and now we're getting different [Music] so you can hear we're going to get a different F shift for each now there we go foreign doesn't do so much now we're getting nice sound also and we've got our delays here a little Reverb and so then now if we put back our other guys and let's go back to our note shift um median density modifiers bar turn these guys on too much now we tried different these ones are pretty famous these Sundial ones so [Music] so this is that kind of glassy sound right [Music] same principle [Music] we want a little more of that for sure so let's put our [Music] foreign [Music] so that is a how we make that kind of classy type sound and again this is just using these same basic three things only we're using in a different way instead of using the FM amount and having two oscillators right now we are just using one oscillator by just shifting it back over to here and then we're modulating this kind this this the F shift instead of say the FM amount or um it's one of the other ones so this is a great way um to make and and again these if you use this format there's also format simple and grain simple and complex that will do this in a different way but the one to get that this type of sound just by modulating this F shift and F spread a lot of people ask about that kind of glassy sound and as you can see it's very simple for or similar to uh the basic FM type of sound you're just modulating different parameters um and you'll find that actually a lot of the different types of sounds she makes are are very similar um concepts of of how you put the modulation together it's just using different um you know putting the modulation to a different uh place and and for that patch and um using different types of oscillators so let me just check my notes here and see because there was something else I wanted to talk about um I in the next video when I'm going to do this one I

and for that patch and um using different types of oscillators so let me just check my notes here and see because there was something else I wanted to talk about um I in the next video when I'm going to do this one I was focusing on this kind of thing using the sample and hold but mostly the random using the arpeggiator to make those notes as well and then using the velocity on instead of that and then you also have the lfos that you can use as sample and hold clock divisions so you have multiple different methods of doing this kind of sample and hold um uh modulation on your sounds and then again you can either be using the arpeggiator in here you could write your own parts or you could be doing the midi modifier and density um trick uh that is one of my favorite ways to do it if you use the arpeggiator what I would say is that after you then um uh record out some part that you then go through and as I showed you before deleting some of the sounds just finding the ones that you want and deleting the other ones um because that's a great thing about the midi modifiers is that when you put the density at 20 you only get 20 of the notes coming through so you have a lot less to delete when you're going to use the arpeggiator you might have a really full um ARP there and you have a pattern that has a lot of stuff going on so you want to delete some of those later you also can make your arpeggiator your your sequence um not an even number of bars long so that it will shift so if you make it say six instead of eight bars long and then it'll take a few bars to cycle back to the very beginning but you'll get a longer pattern that way and it'll change around um but so that these are just different ways to do sample and hold modulation for example also um using FM or say using this formant complex to do the put the modulation on the F shift as well um then you again here you know you can juice when you're done you get here go into this section and you can juice up your sound a little bit you can use the filter Banks you can use the phaser you can use the Distortion to change how you want and then you have your delay and Reverb here which again I will say that a lot of times when I end up recording this I will take these off and then do it at the end uh to my recorded audio that way I have a bit more um maneuverability when I'm uh playing with the recorded audio part um so that is basically what I wanted to go through this time next I'm going to do another video that instead of doing sample and hold does kind of longer manipulations where you get these kind of squelchy sounds you'll find that it's actually very similar to this just using different types of modulation and putting the modulation onto different things for example the pitch instead of the uh you know filter frequency or combination of both um anyway so that'll be the next one the next video focus on squelches and I'll do that in virus and I'll jump into pigments as well um but thanks for listening if you guys have any questions about anything I know it's kind of rambling all over the place but I just wanted to go through and show a couple different types of sounds that I make and I'm just going to play around for a sec while we watch and I can show you go back to it to close out so as I finish up here just want to say thank you and I look forward to hearing please put your comments and feedback and I'm happy to answer any questions thanks guys [Music] foreign so let's record this one and I'll show you something here so [Music] oh as I just said I want to take off these guys boom boom and you'll see why in a second [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we've got that first I'm just going to put it to a new channel so that's my record channel so now since I took off and

can show you go back to it to close out so as I finish up here just want to say thank you and I look forward to hearing please put your comments and feedback and I'm happy to answer any questions thanks guys [Music] foreign so let's record this one and I'll show you something here so [Music] oh as I just said I want to take off these guys boom boom and you'll see why in a second [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we've got that first I'm just going to put it to a new channel so that's my record channel so now since I took off and that's just I've got my instrument bust just mute that now we have the tab it's great because we still have the delay here when I pull down it just makes a duplicate of that track now this is why I wonder so I put the delay here instead of on the other channel one thing that I like to do is to make yourself some of your sounds especially like kind of backgroundy sounds like this to swell in and out so I used to use this great plugin called doctor device if you guys have used that you know what I'm talking about um I'm going to do it a different way here instead of using one thing I'm going to just put on an LFO tool and show you guys that you can use this if we put it it has filter here so if we um put the routing the LFO routing up on the cutoff here put it to a band pass put the cutoff down resonance up now and we have to then slow it down so you can see some of the notes are going to come through and some are not [Music] and so this is basically just a filter moving back and forth across it [Music] all right so now let's go back to the virus and I'm just going to switch back to I'm going to put a full long note here I'm going to go back to our other sound turn these guys off so now let's do our FM [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] lead here [Music] here [Applause] [Music] all right well that was fun thanks a lot guys and it was a long video um

Rack a lot of people have been doing videos on this and kind of showing this new version um but they're kind of jumping right into patches and I just wanted to for people like you guys who might not have um ever used modular before and you know you open up a synth and you look at this and you say what the heck am I looking at so I wanted to just give a quick overview and show one patch and just kind of make things make sense a little bit more for you so this is vcv rack 2 which I'm using um as a VST which you have to pay for it was free as a standalone which is very it's just great and you can play around with it but for complete integration into your Daw I would definitely recommend paying for it if once you've played with it and you and you like it um because it just makes it so much easier to use I've been waiting for them to do this for a long time so I'm super excited about it um and so basically um if you think about modular it's just the same as uh you know fixed architecture synthesizers or and and vsts and stuff except that you kind of have to build them yourself all the pieces are the same except you get to choose the pieces and you have to make the connections um so whereas in a VST you would open it up and you can just start playing and you turn something on and it works and you use the modulation matrixes to do the routing here we have to do all the routing by hand but it's not that hard um and it's not that if you just break it down it's not overwhelming I think um so the first thing to think about is when we open up a new patch here it should gives us two things one of them is this midi to CV and one is audio so basically this is the out and this is the in and so it's already hooked up to our Daw which is the awesome thing about it and you can choose the midi channel here so now if in our synth like if in Cubase if I you know um play if I hit a note here right um it will eventually play but I have to hook things up first so anyways we're going to figure out how to do this but we're just going to set up a basic basic patch and I'm going to show you the layout so the first thing what we can do is you can also download Lots they have thousands of um of of modules available my suggestion is do not download them all at once because um it's just too much to get your head around so start with maybe a couple of things I really love instru um you know the um braids I'm sorry mutable instrument stuff is good but really the basic ones that they have have enough stuff that you can you can use so I would start playing with it and then go back in and download them all so anyways let's start off and think about what is the first thing we need well we need something that makes sound right so I'm gonna show you guys we're just going to take the neoni from instra and so all we have to do here is we take the output and so like this is a Sawtooth output so if we take the Sawtooth output and put it there it's automatically blank now why is it going all the way because this is what has oscillators are con the signal is constantly playing you know when we you know when you have to hit a note to turn on the synthesizer it this is the same in your if you have a virus if you have any any and well not in a computer I mean but analog stuff they're all one the second you power it on it is spitting out that signal it's just that you're not capturing it it's not going anywhere so um you know you think about these things they're constantly running um and all we have to do is kind of build our patch to make um to be able to control these things so right now this is just playing um and what we can do to start hooking things up is if we take so voltage proactive right this is go and we put this into the voltage proactive here right so now if I play a note on my keyboard right I'm choosing the note but as you know I'm not there's no envelope it's still just triggering right so how do we make it trigger from playing the keyboard so we need an envelope right so let's just take an adsr and then this is the thing the key thing here that is a little bit difficult about um the first thing when I first got my modular I bought a bunch of oscillators some filters and stuff and then I said wait a minute how do I apply an envelope and in the norm in you know in soft synths and stuff you would just apply the amount or use the modulation Matrix but", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name":

modular I bought a bunch of oscillators some filters and stuff and then I said wait a minute how do I apply an envelope and in the norm in you know in soft synths and stuff you would just apply the amount or use the modulation Matrix but here we need what's called a VCA voltage controlled amplifier and so just to talk about these things like what voltage controlled means is that it's controlled by voltages right and CV means control voltage so if you take um so these are the things that are really important about it and this is why it's called vcv rack virtual control voltage rack okay and so you have different things and then midi remember that with the different types of things that we have from midi right are you get your voltage per octave which is different than CV just because it's one volt proactive whereas CV is not one volt per octave it's like a plus or minus 10 volts so anyways this is just makes it so that each step is you know a different note on the keyboard you have your gate which is the length of the with the keyboard press velocity uh after touch the mod wheel pitch wheel any of your clock re-trigger start stop and continue trigger so these are just the different things that I've been getting from the midi device and so one of these is going to be uh you know gate or Trigger Time right so if we put this gate into the gate of our now when you see I'm clicking my keyboard we're getting our thing to hit and so then we want to apply it so what we need is what's called a VCA voltage controlled and amplifier so um what we want to do here is just run the signal through it so if we go in and then out and then now if we take the envelope from our adsr and put it into this now if I hit this you see it is triggering oh the envelope so now we have and if I let go it's off and we have our decay here we have our sustain and our release right so we're we're getting there now what's the other thing that we you know want in Ascent in anything well a filter right so let's grab a filter and so in filters are called vcfs vs voltage controlled filters right and so there's tons of different types that we can get here um let's just pick something well you know in sticking with the um why not where I was using as if we're using well here let's just use the basic one so you can see so now before we go in I'm just going to stop through into our filter on the way so if we go here and let's take a high pass right why not and put up some resonance okay I'm going to delete this one actually um and I am gonna let's take let's stick with instrument they have a bunch of different ones um let's check this one why not okay so if we then go out the saw into the in and let's take the iPads and go out this is our cue [Music] [Applause] right and now um the other thing we could have is you know an LFO right so let's just grab uh um we'll just do this one so you can see right so we have a basic wave shape here and this is I guess the wave table out so if we put into the CV here [Applause] [Music] there we go see so I'll just put the [Music] [Applause] so this is modulating this and this is the amount right so we don't need to go through a VCA here because this one has an attenuate attenuverter on it so if you have an atteniverter you can skip so now it's just this is not applied right and then now it's modulating this right so we've already got you know a basic thing going here and as you can see that if you just think about it as individual pieces of the you know fixed architecture synth you know it'll make a lot more sense and obviously you know you can read the manuals on all of these devices that can help a lot but you know if you start small and work your way up um it'll make a lot more sense to you", "start_char_idx": 3562,

can read the manuals on all of these devices that can help a lot but you know if you start small and work your way up um it'll make a lot more sense to you and so this is the key thing here is that if you're trying to apply an envelope or an LFO or something to a signal path you either need to go through a VCA or something that has an attenuator because you could just put this we could put this this output right into say the um you know voltage proactive um of the synth right let's say here so now when I'm playing I can't tune the note but this thing can see and it's going to come down here but I can't control the amount because there's no amount here you know there's no attenuator so how do I control the amount so this would be if I wanted to do if I wanted to run this LFO into the course pitch here which I might want to do this is how you make squelchy sounds you know but you don't want it necessarily full on and full off you want an amount right so you would just pass it through avca but in this time you don't have a CV signal so then you're controlling the amount here so all the way down not doing anything now I'm controlling how much of this is controlling this [Applause] right [Applause] so if you're ever thinking how do I attenuate that how do I make it say how do I do the amount of it well you're probably missing a VCA um and so yeah that is this is just the very very basic basic just kind of walk through um of thinking about it and the key thing here is right you know you need to just route the things together and if you're trying to input a modulation into a signal path and there's no way to attenuate the signal by using attenuators like in you know here 10 inverters this one has it this one you know doesn't some of them have this is the attenuator attenuator or attenuverters the difference is attenuator is from zero to full right a 10 inverters is you have their their bipolar so you can go neg I mean you know you can invert it right so this is a positive or the negative way right and to zero in the middle here so 10 inverter attenuator different but those are what you're looking for if those are in there you could you won't need to go through a VCA but otherwise you're going to want to go through a VCA just so that you can attenuate the signal all right um so that is my super basic very very basic just intro to plugging things in and um getting things going and oh one other let me just do one last thing here sorry I forgot um if I want to show you so this is a clock thing right so this is I mean this is a sample and hold and so let's say we wanted to instead of modulating this make squelchy thing we'll put this back um no well we can leave that and then I what I want to do here is use the clock out because this is a sample and hold so now we want the clock we need we need to get some signal from the synth so I mean signal from our um from the the Daw so we have the clock divider output here and this is really useful so we can put into the input here and then if we hit play are we playing um oh sorry I'm not going to clock in this clock input so now you can see it's dividing and we can choose the division of the clock here right so it's on quarter notes we could do 16th notes right now it's on 16th notes so now like we could then take the output of this and put it to say here so now [Music] la la just to give an example right so but I just wanted to show how you can clock things right so these are the clocks and you can divide this one into different notes which is nice this one is always going to be on the actual like on this the fast one so", "start_char_idx": 7155, "end_char_idx": 11459, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

now I want to show you a patch that I just was working on last night which just takes in some of these some of these things so I'm going to open up this uh yep clear all right so what I've got going on here is I'm not triggering anything I'm using the clocks this thing doesn't need to be here I'm using the clock to trigger the gate so it's going 16th notes every single time then I have the clock also clocking you see there's three of them going here one to the trigger of the adsr one to this one and one to this just so that the clock that's the same rate it's just that it's random so there are two different randoms you can see they don't match up right then what I'm doing here is I have the filter and I'm modulating it with the attenuverter here and it is a high pass right then I'm modulated using the random output to clock this oh wait there we go I just had to change the key of the day and this is two neoni's right so I'm taking the saw output of one going into the FM input and then this is the amount right so nothing no then this of course kind of controls the master pitch and then this one is like the um Timbre all right foreign mode and then I'm modulating here this output is also coming to the CD input here which with this switch on up this is the destination of this CV attenuator right down to the wave folder up it modulates the split saw tooth right so it's modulating this around and then so let's just hear this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay some pretty cool um pretty cool right so this is why this this plugin I mean this thing has so much potential because you have so many cool things like these two neonis I have the real one in my uh here and you know this it sounds awesome so there's just so much you can do and you see here I'm not even triggering I'm not even I'm just using the clock to make a sequence and then mod using two randoms to modulate some of the the parameters and we're getting really cool pattern already um so yeah that is the basics of uh vcv rack that I wanted to show you and can go into more detail um later but I just wanted to give a a rundown to kind of just break it down so that it doesn't seem so um you know formidable um and it's something that you can easily get into and you can experiment around but so now I just wanted to show you how would I polish off one of these sounds right what I want to do with it how do I fit it in because that one's going all over the place right there so let's do our tricks that I showed you before so the first thing I'm going to do I'm just going to record um well actually one thing I kind of liked here is that I was getting two different notes so what I'm going to do is um I'm in um what do we mean f so I'm going to go here and I'm not sure I can't remember which ones but I just want to what I want to do is just get because uh this course knob is changing the frequency of it so let's just see here if I'm in [Music] so let's take these and go down one more [Music] [Music] [Applause] and so now what I want to do is um let's I could record it but I'm just going to show you in here in the things let's do exactly what we did",

do is um let's I could record it but I'm just going to show you in here in the things let's do exactly what we did before because this is kind of like all over the place so let's just try using a similar thing as before let's take infiltrator let's just do it with infiltrator so the same thing I was showing before we just want to get some modulation going on a filter and then running through some delay and on this one maybe we'll use stereo something like that let's see what happens [Applause] [Music] more like this right you can even then put some other like [Music] [Applause] okay [Music] so now let's listen with one of the other ones right [Applause] [Applause] [Music] that's maybe going down a little too far here [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so just an example here you know but again like just by putting [Music] [Music] that a little better foreign [Music] so anyways just the point to try to show you how you know afterwards you could finish that thing yeah you'd also can as I said put on other things like even if we just uh if we put on I really love going back to this I love the phasers and flanges and stuff from yuhi here now uh just to hear it for a second I'm just gonna let's go to washed or something like that all right [Music] sounds super cool [Music] foreign [Music] that is basically everything I wanted to show you guys for now", "start_char_idx": 14040,

how to warp a track in Ableton this is something that a lot of people have asked um I'm gonna go and do another set about how I set up my live set but I wanted to just first do uh this one just to show you how you take a track and how you warp it so um I will just even start from complete scratch here I'm gonna grab a track and drop it in um and so the first thing that you want to do is it helps if you know the BPM but it's not actually uh urgent so the first thing you want to do is just go and find just like if you're DJing on CD players you would find that first uh kick and you would go and you would want to set that as your cue point so I'm going to zoom in you know if you zoom in real far you get these little points um so you want to go a little bit just below that you can see here probably right around where it crosses the one point you want to get a zero Crossing if you can so something like this would be good you can always adjust this later so anyways the first thing to do is to set a yellow point at your first kick then what you're going to do is right click or control click if you're using a laptop and you set 1.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1227,

start the track right at the beginning now you'll see here that I still have this yellow point back here that came when it first set in so you want to get rid of that and also if there were any there might have been a lot of yellow points that come out that were already set up in here but you'll get rid of these by when you first set your point if you just set one by one here and then the next thing to do is you say wipe from here straight so this will warp the track based on what uh if it's BPM not the BPM of the track you could also do work from here at 150 which will set it at the track BPM or you could do BPM from here but basically the one you want for your live sets is to warp from here straight so let's do that now you see that it's gotten rid of these other um points so we don't have them anymore and uh that's what we want you don't want to go through and make lots of yellow points because basically if I put a yellow Point here and I move this it's only moving what's in between so it's not going to change this point it's only going to change the part in between if I put another one here you see that it's stretching this part and stretching this part out so every time that you move something with the yellow dot you're going to be distorting the rest of it so again we don't want any yellow dots except for our first one here so go back and let's work from straight again so that's going to set the whole track straight now what we want to do is we want to go somewhere near the end of the track I have a little bit of a fade out here so let's find a nice kick this one looks pretty good so we can see here that it's not exactly on this is our kick here so what we want to do is you see that there's a little Point here that you could turn into a yellow Point by double clicking it don't double click it just use that point without double clicking it to drag your place over and you can zoom in to get uh you know the different to get it so right here now we see we've got a zero point right there zero Crossing so that's what we're going to want and so you see I did not create a new yellow point so basically all we have is at the beginning of a track we have one yellow and at the end we have gone in and found um one point and fixed it now if we go everywhere in between we'll be on so if we go to 148 we're right there very good so now [Music] that is warp track so I'm going to start I'm going to grab one more for you guys so let's say um uh uh what other track did I just get here all right whatever it doesn't make a difference really which track it is I'm just gonna show you a new one but so it really doesn't make a difference just pick one here subtract loads it has we oh and again the one thing too here is we want our things on repitch this is important part repitch so let's follow the process again I'm going to go and find my first place that looks pretty good so I set one from here warp from here straight zoom out delete that first point go towards the end find a clear kick this looks good enough yes there we go and without making a point drag it over if you need to zoom in to get it right and there you go one point and that's all now if we were to put just to show you that they are working if we were to put don't I don't like this eq3 but just to show you um I don't use this really but just to give you the idea of it so for uh so here we can turn off the mids and highs and leave the lows of this vertical track or if this is me in vertical [Music] thank you [Music] so as you can see those two tracks are lined up and it's pretty simple process so thanks a lot thanks for watching I'll be doing more soon take care", "start_char_idx": 1227, "end_char_idx": 4985, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",
